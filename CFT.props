# Semicolon-separated list of directories to locate code, in sequence
# from work-directories towards library directories. 

# The first directory is the default save directory. This means that working
# on a script file from one of the other directories, when you save it, you
# don't overwrite the original, but instead store it in the first directory,
# and may later manually move it to the target directory, when it's ok.
