Sorting
-------

Sorting in CFT is done via the List.sort() function.

It sorts lists of strings or numbers (int or float), and nothing
else. The key to sort other content, is to "mask" it as
one of the those, usually String or int. 

There are three global functions for this:

Int(<int>, data)
Str(<str>, data)
Float(<float>, data)

The resulting objects Int, Str, Float, are subclasses of
the internal types int, String and float, so sort() will
not know any difference.


Number types
-------------
The int type in CFT is implemented as Long in Java,
and the float type is Double in Java.


Now an example.
