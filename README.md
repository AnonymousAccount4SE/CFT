ConfigTool - an automation shell written in Java

Created by Roar Foshaug, Trondheim, Norway


# ConfigTool - CFT

## Getting started

Please read the Doc.html stored under ./doc for an introduction to CFT.

The project is currently built with Apache ANT, and results in a single JAR-file.

## Once built, run using ./cft shell script or .\cft.cmd for windows.

## Going Open Source

Having reached the v1.0 milestone, ConfigTool is now robust enough for others
to enjoy, without having to understand (all) the inner workings.
