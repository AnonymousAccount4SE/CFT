# CFT - ConfigTool

An automation shell written in Java.

CFT was initiated at some point during 2018, as a multi purpose tool for 
interactive use and easy automation. It has been extended as needs arose. 

CFT is a programming language with the initial purpose of getting useful work
out of single lines of code.

- searching code
- searching multiple log files
- file copy, rename, move
- interfacing external programs
- code generation 
- programming fun

## Getting started

1. The project is currently builds with Apache ANT, and results in a single JAR-file.
2. Once built, run using ./cft shell script or .\cft.cmd for windows.
3. Please read the comprehensive Doc.html stored under ./doc for an introduction to CFT

## Going Open Source

Having reached a level of robustness and fairly reliable error handling, 
version 1.0 was assigned, as it is now robust enough for others to enjoy
without having to understand (all) the inner workings.
