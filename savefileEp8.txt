Date processing
---------------

The global Date() function produces a Date object for the
current date and time. Internally it is represented as
milliseconds. 

A Date object contains a format string, as defined by
SimpleDateFormat in Java, which is by default set to

"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"



Date arithmethic
----------------
The Date object has a function called Duration(), which 
produces a Duration object. It in turn contains functions
for defining the duration. The Duration object is used
in Date calculations, and is also the result when comparing
two dates.


Example
-------
We will create a simple function which returns true if
a log file in our "logs" directory is newer than one minute,
otherwise false.
