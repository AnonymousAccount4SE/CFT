Searching
---------

We will use the JavaFiles function created
earlier, and create a simple function that
inputs a search string, then searches through all
the java files.

The Grep object
---------------
Since searching is a common task, there is a global
function, Grep() which returns a Grep object. It
in turn has a function .file(SomeFile) which searches
through the file (in Java) and delivers a list of 
matching lines.

Those line objects are a subclass of regular String,
containing two additional functions:

.file()

The file the match is from


.lineNumber

Linenumber in that file (1-based)

Using report()
--------------
As we want output on readable format, we replace
the out() with report(). The difference is that
out() delivers single values to the result list
in loops, while report() takes multiple values
and formats them as strings into columns.
