.object $OBJ(ladder)
$OBJ can be upright from $G (location) to $X (location) when height of $X above $G is less than length of $OBJ


.object $OBJ(rope)
$OBJ can be attached to $L (location with fixture for tying a rope) at location $L and used to climb down to $X (location) 
	below $X when length of $OBJ is greater then height of $F above $X

$OBJ has two ends 
$OBJ has a length

tying $OBJ to $F (fixture) creates a knot at (one end of) $OBJ
untying $OBJ eliminates the knot
