Persistence of data
-------------------

CFT is created to be as stateless as possible. 

There are no global variables, only code in the form
of functions. 

To remember things, we can of course write data to
file, but this quickly becomes complex. What we need
is to store complete data structures.

In CFT this is called synthesis.


Synthesis
---------
Synthesis in CFT means converting data to code which when
run, generates the original data. 

It is available as "colon command" :syn to convert last
result to code, which can then be assigned a name, or
inside the language as the global syn() function.

This allows us to convert store complex structures to strings,
and back again by using eval() on such a string.


The Db2 data store
------------------

To avoid creating lots of single files for various content,
a simple data store has been created. It is called Db2, since
the first Db was so bad it had to be replaced :-)

Db2 uses the syn() function to create a string representation
that is stored to collection files, and eval() to run that
code when loading data.
