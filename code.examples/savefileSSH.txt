-------------------------------------------------
Script file for distributing ssh key to remote
servers, to enable ssh without password. If you
have not done so, first create an rsa key, by
running the following command in Linux shell

$ shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa
exit

Then run sshEnable, to copy that file to 
remote hosts. 

Sudo without password
---------------------
Log in as root, add the following line to 
/etc/sudoers

username	ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
