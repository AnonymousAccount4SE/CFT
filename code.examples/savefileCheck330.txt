# With the upgrade to version 3.3.0, looking up a closure
# from a Dictionary via .identifier means the closure is
# invoked, possibly with parameters, as for all dotted
# parts.
#
# This script contains functions to locate places in 
# script code that may have to be updated.
#
# Note that Lambda and Closure objects do not automatically
# get invoked other than when retrieved via dictionary
# lookup, so for example the following code remains unchanged:
#
#  P(1,Lambda{}) => Lsomething
#  ...
#  Lsomething.call
