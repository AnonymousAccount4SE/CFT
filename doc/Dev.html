<h1>CFT Change log</h1>

<h3>v1.1.13 2020-08-29</h3>
<p>
	Moved SSH script file from code.examples to code.lib. Various script cleanup.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.12 2020-08-29</h3>
<p>
	Added Date.Duration.fmt() function
</p>
<p>
	Rewritten SSH script, moved code from ServersMaintenance
</p>

<h3>v1.1.11 2020-08-28</h3>
<p>
	Fixed bug in Db script
</p>

<h3>v1.1.10 2020-08-27</h3>
<p>
	Changed Db script into key/value store with multiple collections
</p>

<h3>v1.1.9 2020-08-26</h3>
<p>
	- Fixed '?ident' so that if matching only one function, all lines are showed.
</p>
<p>
	- Added String.chars() function
</p>
<p>
	- Added List.last() function
</p>
<p>
	- Created Db script under code.lib
</p>

<h3>v1.1.8 2020-08-24</h3>
<p>
	- Added Sys.homeDir() function.
</p>
<p>
	- Modified Investigate script, putting investigation files into "investigate.d" directory under 
	home directory. Breaking logs into files named by date. Adjusted ".gitignore". Removed file
	reference to ".investigate" (old log file in home dir) from Release script.
</p>
<p>
	- Added Dir.unprotect() and File.unprotect(). These require the dir or file to be protected,
	otherwise throwing exception, as these are not to be used routinely.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.7 2020-08-21 Added LastExtProgramStatus java class</h3>
<p>
	Pointer to one such object inside ObjGlobal. Method to clear it, set it
	and get it.
</p>
<p>
	Created function Sys.lastEPS() which returns the status as int, or -999 if undefined. Also
	created function Sys.lastEPSData() which returns Dict or null if undefined.
</p>
<p>
	Implemented for Dir.run() and Dir.runCapture(), plus Dir.runProcessWait()
</p>


<h3>v1.1.6b 2020-08-19 Added Lib.Exp.onCtxClose(macro)</h3>
<p>
	Mostly for testing, but might be nice to have if creating return() statement, acts like
	a finally in Java, except only when no exception ....
</p>
<p>
	Hmm, that's a thing to consider, 
	being able to ensure the code runs even when errors. 
</p>

<h3>v1.1.6b 2020-08-19 Added object Lib.Exp</h3>
<p>
	Created Lib.Exp function/object for experimental code. 
</p>

<h3>v1.1.6a 2020-08-19 Investigate script</h3>
<p>
	Changed text log format, for readability, simplified the commands, and created
	input-mode which loops until entering ".."	
</p>
<p>
	Modified the shortcuts in CFT.props as well
</p>

<h3>v1.1.6 2020-08-14 Small fix on ServersManagement / KVM scripts</h3>
<p>
	Instead of "sudo something" it is safer to do "sudo bash" followed by "something".
</p>

<h3>v1.1.5e 2020-08-11 Renamed Lib.LogFiles to Lib.Files</h3>
<p>
	Will contain tools for all types of file processing
</p>
<p>
	Created Lib.Files.FilterReader (LineReader, Grep), for fast search, shortcutting the need
	to create huge amounts of CFT line objects that will only be thrown away.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.5d 2020-08-08 Grep.line()</h3>
<p>
	Added function that matches single line, for use with LineReader etc
</p>

<h3>v1.1.5c 2020-08-08 Bugfix previous change</h3>

<h3>v1.1.5b 2020-08-08 Improved error handling LineReader</h3>

<h3>v1.1.5a 2020-08-07 Added CtxCloseHook</h3>
<p>
	Letting LineReader register via this hook, via its start() function. Removed LineReader.close() function and
	updated Doc.html.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-08-06 Tagging v1.1.4</h2> 


<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-06 Lib.LogFiles.LineReader</h3>
<p>
	Created LineReader function and persistent object, for reading lines from a file.
</p>
<p>
	Every time the LineReader() function is invoked for the same file object, it
	is reset to start reading from first line.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-06 Lib.LogFiles / moved DateSort</h3>
<p>
	Created Lib.LogFiles and moved DateSort into it.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-05 MongoHA</h3>
<p>
	Added support for a prefix to all host names, so that mcfg1, mcfg2, mcfg3 and so on becomes
	bmcfg1, bmcfg2, ... if prefix is "b". Creating VM's with these names and separate IP-addresses,
	lets us configure multiple MongoDB HA enviroments with the same script.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-05 Scripts</h3>
<p>
	Added functions to ServersMaintenance to set /etc/hostname and configure /etc/netplan
	for VM's. Added code to the KVM Clone() function to use these, so that it now configures
	the newly created clone then reboots it. 
</p>
<p>
	This means there is no need as such to install CFT on the clone template VM, as
	all initial setup is managed from the outside. The VM script is becoming obsolete.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.4 2020-08-03 Doc</h3>
<p>
	Had to add a section "Fun and strange stuff", since there are a bit of those.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-08-03 Tagging v1.1.3</h2> 


<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-03 various</h3>
<p>
 	- Lib script: Improved menu selection to prefer exact match if possible.
</p>
<p>
	- Created MongoHA script which installs mongodb, mongo shell and mongos on servers in a
	HA configuration (EXPERIMENTAL)
</p>
<p>
	- Created Systemd script, with a function CreateService, called from MongoHA for setting
	up mongos as a service (EXPERIMENTAL)
</p>
<p>
	- Changed syntax for inline lists of text, so that one may use any number 
	of '&lt;' or '&gt;' as long as there as at least three, followed by a space and
	the identifier. This means it gets easier to see the inline text beginning and end.
</p>
<pre>
	&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; EOF
	this is
	some text
	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EOF
</pre>
<p>
	- Added Dict.hasNullValue() function. Using it to detect if result from PDict() contains
	unmatched parameters.
</p>
<p>
	- Upgraded the Investigate script from experimental to normal, as it is now considered
	useful (and has been used for several days). 
</p>

<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-02 KVM script</h3>
<p>
	Updated documentation (Readme function).
</p>

<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-02 :sw</h3>
<p>
	Fixed :sw so that exact match overrides partial match when switching to different
	script.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-02 DateSort.search()</h3>
<p>
	Created DateFormat.search to locate lines between date/time intervals in log files where lines
	start with date/time. It uses binary search internally, to locate start-point to read from,
	with random access reads. Should be fast even for huge log files.
</p>
<p>
	Example
</p>
<pre>
	Dir(...).protect
	/LogDir

	# Show log lines for 10 minutes
	Input("Date YYYY-MM-DD").get=d
	Input("Time HH:MM:SS").get=t
	Date.parse(d+" "+t).get =startTimeMs
	LogDir.files-&gt;f
		DateSort.search(f,startTimeMs,startTimeMs+10*60*1000)-&gt;line 
			out(line)
	| _=allLines
	DateSort.asc(allLines)
	/Search
</pre>


<h3>v1.1.3 2020-08-01 File.tail</h3>
<p>
	Using RandomAccessFile, calculating a likely offset from end of file. This is done via
	an assumed max line length (in bytes), which defaults to 256. This means the 
	tail() function uses same amount of
	time regardless of file size. If lines are on average longer, then fewer lines will be
	returned.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-08-01 Tagging v1.1.2</h2>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-08-01 root input loop</h3>
<p>
	Added logic so that input loop displays prompt only when no buffered input lines, as
	with Input.get and readLine()
</p>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-08-01 SSH script</h3>
<p>
	Improved SSH script so that it creates target .ssh directory if it doesn't exist.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Doc update</h3>
<p>
	Included the .protect feature earlier, and reorganized a bit
</p>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 File.protect / Dir.protect</h3>
<p>
	Made parameter optional, calling it desc instead of "code".
</p>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Improved Investigation script</h3>
<p>
	Standardized file output. Changed shortcuts to lower case.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Logical bug</h3>
<p>
	!a && !b  failed
</p>
<p>
	Seemed to end up as !(a && !(b)) due to indiscriminate Expr matching. 
</p>
<p>
	Fixed in ExprTerminal, where notExpr is now ExprE instead of Expr. Verified by simple
	truth table listout.
</p>
<pre>
a=true b=true false
a=true b=false false
a=false b=true false
a=false b=false true
</pre>

<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-31 Colon command overhaul</h3>
<p>
	Improved feedback when typing just ":"
</p>
<p>
	Added :sw which switches between loaded scripts by partial match, or lists all
	available if no (partial) identifier given
</p>


<h3>v1.1.2 2020-07-27 Doc overhaul</h3>
<p>
	Replaced old term "code blocks" with "loop spaces", leaving "block expressions" and macros
	unchanged.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-07-27 Tagging v1.1.1</h2>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-27 created Sys.uptime</h3>
<p>
	Just for fun.
</p>
<p>
	Also fixed some "errror" messages (typos).
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 created PropsFile prompt code field</h3>
<p>
	Added code to CFT.props:

	prompt = Sys.scriptName=x if(x==null,"$ ",x+" $ ")
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 created Sys.scriptName</h3>
<p>
	Returns script name only - used by prompt script
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 moved savefile() to Sys.savefile()</h3>
<p>
	Also makes it return null when not defined, instead of error. Modified the @e shortcut accordingly.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-24 moved isWindows to Sys.isWindows()</h3>
<p>
	Cleaning up global namespace
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-23 Error handling</h3>
<p>
	Created SourceException which improves error handling, by wrapping non-SourceExceptions into
	SourceExceptions at certain points, getting an indication about where the error occurred also
	for exceptions from inside java libraries, such as trying to read a file that doesn't exist.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-23 Moved stdin() to Sys.stdin()</h3>
<p>
	The global statement stdin() is now function stdin() inside Sys object, in an effort
	to clear up global name space, and stdin is a natural name for a file parameter
	to Dir.runProcess* functions.
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-22 ServersMaintenance script</h3>
<p>
	Improved this script with new function RemoteCommandSetCoded() to easily categorize
	output from ssh session. The RemoteCommandSet function is improved as well, 
	echoing a marker string, and looking for it in stdout, to eliminate the
	welcome text when logging in. It also returns stderr lines, prefixing output
	lines with (stdout) or (stderr).
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-22 File.tail and .head</h3>
<p>
	Added File.head, and modified File.tail, so both return empty list
	if file doesn't exist, rather than exception.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-21 Dir.runProcessWait timeout</h3>
<p>
	Added 5 minutes timeout
</p>


<h3>v1.1.1 2020-07-21 Dir.runProcessWait</h3>
<p>
	Functions like .runProcess() but waits for process to terminate. Dir.runProcess() was written
	for a case where we wanted to run up to 100 background node processes, for stress testing. 
	That is a valid use case, so leaving it unmodified, creating new function instead.
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-07-21 Tagging v1.1</h2>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 P(N,Expr)</h3>
<p>
	Made resolving optional default-value Expr lazy, so only resolved when needed. This allows us to put
	interactive code as default, asking for the value, and saves us a "when (value==null, ...)"
	in the code.
</p>
<pre>
P(1,Input("Enter value").get) =value
</pre>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 ServersMaintenance script</h3>
<p>
	Created script for automating apt-get update etc, on a number of hosts, based on
	SSH script for key based ssh (no password) plus adding to /etc/sudoers for
	password-less sudo command. See Readme in SSH script.
</p>
<p>
	Also added @SM shortcut for ServersMaintenance script.
</p>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 Sys.sleep(millis)</h3>
<p>
	Added this to enable waiting for completion of external processes
</p>


<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-21 SSH script</h3>
<p>
	Created script for distributing ssh key to various hosts, for password free login
</p>


<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-20 Projects script</h3>
<p>
	Improved Projects script message when projects.txt file missing
</p>

<h3>v1.1.0 2020-07-20 debug mode / KVM</h3>
<p>
	Extended the :debug mode into the code, currently logging the source-location of
	each statement and Expr as it gets executed, and used this to find bug in KVM script.
</p>

<h2 class="tag">2020-07-19 Tagging v1.0.17</h2>
<pre>
v1.0.17 is now frozen. Next version is v1.1. 
Changes since v1.0:

	- cd/ls/edit/more 
	- error() function
	- when() expression
	- macros / block expressions
	- Root class handles multiple ObjGlobal 
	- full functionality in macros
	- CFT.props file / source dirs 
	- shell command
	- Dir and File protect
	- symlink awareness, though not fully handled
	- Grep memory use / limits / .fileCount
	- Lib script improvements / terminal size
	- Sys.lastResult / Investigate script (early version)
	- general Projects script
	- shortcuts, particularly @e freeing up symbol 'e' from all scripts

	- various bugs and improvements
</pre>




<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-18 terminal size</h3>
<p>
	Added shortcut @term to check size of terminal. Had to move the ObjCfg instance from
	ObjGlobal to Root. 
</p>
<p>
	Changed Lib.m() to use system more on Windows as well.
</p>




<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-18 shortcuts</h3>
<p>
	Added shortcuts feature. Consists of config lines in CFT.props, and handling in
	Root.processInteractiveInput.
</p>

<p>
	Example from CFT.props
</p>
<pre>
# Shortcuts
#
# The shortcuts are lines of code. If that code results in a macro, it is invoked with
# no parameters. Since we don't need parameters, there is really no need for macros
# here. The return value from a shortcut becomes the "last value", available
# via Sys.lastResult, as well as used by :syn etc
#
# Note that shortcuts only work when the prefix is at the start of the interactive
# input line. 
# ---
shortcutPrefix = @

shortcut:r = stdin(":load Release","?")
shortcut:p = stdin(":load Projects","?")

# List available shortcuts when typing '@' only
# ---
shortcut: = File("CFT.props").read-&gt;line assert(line.contains("shortcut:")) out(line)
</pre>
<p>
	This means typing @r on the comand line, loads "Release" script and lists its content
</p>
<p>
	Also moved PropsFile instance from ObjGlobal, which despite its name has multiple
	instances, into Root, which is the new single master object.
</p>
<p>
	And added autoload to PropsFile (called from top of Root.processInteractiveInput.
</p>
<p>
	Even implemented a default shortcut, when typing only @, which lists the shortcuts
	by searching the CFT.props file!!
</p>



<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 Sys.lastResult()</h3>
<p>
	Created Sys.lastResult() function, that returns the last result as stored inside Root, 
	from previous interactive command.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 :new</h3>
<p>
	Created new colon command "new", to create new empty script and set it as current.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 Projects script</h3>
<p>
	Improved Projects script, making file name filtering more explicitly set and cleared.
</p>
<p>
	Removed CRLF
</p>
<pre>
$ :load Projects
$ savefile.read=x savefile.create(x)
</pre>

<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 reload script bug</h3>
<p>
	Fixed minor bug, when deleting a script file that has been loaded, CFT crashed.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.17 2020-07-17 shell() function</h3>
<p>
	Added CFT.props field "winShell" set to "powershell" as default, 
	while keeping the "shell" field, and differentiating between windows and linux
	in the shell() function.
</p>	




<h2 class="tag">2020-07-17 Tagging v1.0.16</h2>


<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-17 Issue #3</h3>
<p>
	Added Root class, which manages parallel ObjGlobal instances, as
	loaded with :load or when calling functions in other scripts. Handling of interactive
	commands is moved from Runtime to Root. Main and Runtime are both slimmed
	down.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-15</h3>
<p>
	Created CONTRIBUTING.md file
</p>

<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-14</h3>
<p>
	Changed Grep, removing .modeCheck and .modeCount, instead creating .fileCount(file)
	along with .file(file). 
</p>
<p>
	Also retiring the .lines() function. Grep is for files.
</p>
<p>
	Adding script Projects to examples, as well as (private) projects.txt
</p>
<p>
	Added DataFile.keys()
</p>
<p>
	Added code.example savefileProjects.txt which is a generic script for searching
	through different projects, as defined in file projects.txt under CFT home directory.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-12</h3>
<p>
	Changed global error() function to take two parameters: boolean condition and message.
</p>
<p>
	Added newline for readLine. Added common prefix (?) to both readLine() and Input.get()
</p>
<o>
	Moved system messages from OutText to ObjGlobal, ensuring we can present them
	after all interactive processing is complete, for example when Grep.file() passes limits.
</o>

<p>
	Added function Sys.outCount() returning number of values emitted with out(), to do
	cutoffs for huge result sets.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.16 2020-07-11 Grep</h3>
<p>
	Fixed bug so that Grep.file() uses File.getEncoding()
</p>
<p>
	Improved handling of limit, so that if there is a limit, no more than that number of ValueObjFileLine
	are kept in memory at the time.
</p>
<p>
	Also applied a default corresponding to "limitFirst(1000)".
</p>
<p>
	Added Grep.modeCount() which changes .file() and .lines() to return number of matches instead
	of data.
</p>
<p>
	When doing regular search and reaching the limit, a WARNING is issued via the 
	OutText.addSystemMessage()
</p>


<h2 class="tag">2020-07-11 Tagging v1.0.15</h2>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 File.encoding</h3>
<p>
	Merged File.setEncoding() into File.encoding, in order to limit number of functions. Tested synthesis ok. 
</p>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 cleanup</h3>
<p>
	Cleaned up some scripts. Removed File.isSymLink() as there are getting many functions in File.
	A proper treatment of symlinks will require a separate class. For now, protecting symlink against
	destructive operations will have to do.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 symlink detection</h3>
<p>
	Changed symlink restrictions into using the Protection object, and removed special
	handling for isSymlink(). Also added isSymlink() to Dir. Makes sense to maintain only
	one mechanism for blocking operations.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 cat / edit / more</h3>

<p>
	Created class StmtCatEditMore as subclass of StmtShellInteractive, which implements these 
	three functions (as statements) via macros defined in CFT.props.
</p>
<p>
	Works perfectly. Makes it easy to customize key functionality.
</p>
<p>
	Deleted StmtCat standalone implementation from earlier, as this is a much
	more elegant (and fun) solution.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 StmtShellInteractive</h3>
<p>
	Removed substring matching, now that globbing works as it should, as we're using same tokenizer 
	as for code. Example:
</p>
<pre>
	$ cat a.b
</pre>
<p>
	This is three tokens, "a", "." and "b", and so if there is no match on the concatenation "a.b", then
	doing substrings matching would look for file names containg a and dot and b. Not intuitive!
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc
</p>

<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 File.tail(n)</h3>
<p>
	Added function to get n last lines of file.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.15 2020-07-10 Dir.protect() and File.protect()</h3>
<p>
	Protection is a property that can be set on a file or a directory. Any files and directories 
	derived from it, inherit the protection status. 
</p>
<p>
	A protected directory does not allow create, delete or copy file into dir. This includes blocking 
File.uncompress if target dir is protected.
</p>
<p>
A protected file does not allow delete, create, append, copyFrom (target), copyTo, move (source or target)
</p>




<h2 class="tag">2020-07-10 Tagging v1.0.14</h2>



<h3>v1.0.14 2020-07-09 - ls / cd / cat</h3>
<p>
	Implemented common parent class, StmtShellInteractive.java, for all shell functionality: 
	ls, cd, cat, edit, mkdir, rmdir, touch, rm
</p>
<p>
	Using existing parser still.
</p>
<p>
	Implemented and tested StmtLs, StmtCat, StmtCd
</p>

<h3>v1.0.14 2020-07-08 .runCapture</h3>
<p>
	Removed output to screen for Dir.runCapture()
</p>

<h3>2020-07-08 Lib e2()</h3>
<p>
	Created function e2() which edits a file from history. The history is persisted to file .editHistory
	in home directory. Done in preparation for global edit() command, which perhaps with no args
	can run the "Lib:e2" function.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.13 2020-07-07 Lib.Sys becomes just Sys (namespace)</h3>
<p>
	Renamed "Lib.Sys" into "Sys". Renamed function .sysMsg() to .log(). Moved global .codeDirs() inside.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.13 2020-07-06 shell()</h3>
<p>
	Added global function shell() and configuration field in props-file ("shell")
</p>

<h3>v1.0.12 2020-07-05 condOut()</h3>
<p>
	Like out() but with a conditional expression. For situations where assert/reject isn't suitable,
	for example we want to do more logic. Since out() is not an expression it can not be put inside
	an if() or when(), and also it can not be put inside a macro.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.11 2020-07-05 Props</h3>
<p>
	Added PropsFile class, which reads file "CFT.props". Configures only one field,
	codeDirs, which is a list of directories in sequence to search for script files, when
	loading, and using the first when saving. This means the first directory in the list
	is for work.
</p>

<p>
	Added global function codeDirs() which returns list of code dirs, if one wants to list
	content easily.
</p>
<pre>
	codeDirs->d d.files->f out(f)
</pre>



<h3>v1.0.10b 2020-07-04 Symbolic link</h3>
<p>
	Added symbolic link check on File (using nio). Created function .isSymlink() and added
	check preventing the following to operate when symlink: .delete() .create() .append() .move()
</p>


<h3>v1.0.10 2020-07-04 report() and Macro / block expressions</h3>
<p>
	Needed to clarify how report() works: each code block in a function or macro (logically) executes 
	in a single Ctx object. Each code block is (be definition) one loop space, and depending on whether
	there are looping statements there or not, will return either top-of-stack value, or list of elements 
	from calls to out(). Or report().
</p>
<p>
	Calls to report() are collected after the code block has executed, and are run through the Report
	tools, creating a list of strings, which are then added to the OutData, as if they were
	emitted via out(). Doing calls both to out() and to report() still means the lines from report()
	get added to the end of the OutData list.
</p>
<p>
	This same behaviour has now been implemented for ValueMacro, and verified.
</p>



<h3>v1.0.10 2020-07-04 PIPE in macro and block expression</h3>

<p>
	Renamed non-macro {} to "block expressions", as what is called ProgramLine in the code, and is
	the parts separated by PIPE '|', were called "code blocks" before {} was introduced.
</p>
<p>
	Enabled PIPE inside macros (and block expressions), tested ok
</p>
<p>
	Changed name from "plain text" to system messages in class OutText.
</p>
<p>
	Added function Lib.Sys.sysMsg(str) to test behaviour from macros etc
</p>




<h3>v1.0.9b 2020-07-03 Small fixes</h3>
<p>
	Removed FuncOverrides. It was always an abomination, and has never been needed.
</p>
<p>
	Deleted StmtCat - never used.
</p>



<h3>v1.0.9 2020-07-03 ObjFile encoding + small fixes</h3>
<p>
	Added backslash as valid "special" token. It was missing.
</p>
<p>
	Made Runtime.processInteractiveInput() more robust, in that if parsing fails completely,
	then reporting "next tokens" threw null-pointer-exception.
</p>
<p>
	Adding encoding attribute to ObjFile. (.encoding() and .setEncoding(Str)). Default is
	'ISO_8859_1'. Fixed and tested synthesis. Modifying functions .create .append .read .more,
	tested ok! Updated doc.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.8 2020-07-02 cd improvement</h3>
<p>
	Fixed processing of paths including File.separator, including absolute paths, and
	long relative paths, using the pre-existing tokenizer.
</p>
<p>
	Added Doc sections on "changing directory" and "listing files" at top of
	interactive use section.
</p>
<p>
	Improved Doc on generalized sorting etc.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.7b 2020-07-01 Removed some reporting</h3>
<p>
	Removed calls to outText.addPlainText() in ObjDir and ObjFile for situations that
	are what we expect. 
</p>
<p>
	println() can now be called without args for a simple newline
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc for code blocks, to follow section on conditionals
</p>
<p>
	Tiny modification to StmtIterate.execute() to execute single value iteration
	depending on value.getValAsBoolean() - was just considering boolean false, but 
	null is also boolean false (so is empty list, but that is correctly handled anyway).
</p>
<p>
	After the code parsing improvements, saving a script with "here"-documents from CFT
	replaced the "<<< EOF" notation with the generated List() code. Improved this by introducing
	modes to CodeLine objects: "NORMAL" is the default, and means the line was read from
	file, and is to be executed, as well as written back when saving. Then there's "ORIGINAL", which 
	means line was read from file and will be written to file, but not run, because it has been 
	replaced by one (or more) lines of type "GENERATED", which are run together with the "NORMAL"
	lines, but not saved.
</p>



<h3>v1.0.7 2020-06-30 Macro fixes</h3>
<p>
	Changed default macro into the "local" variant, only now it is known as "code-block", as it
	is resolved automatically. To make "independent" macros, the body must start with an
	asterisk '*' indicating it can run anywhere.
</p>

<pre>

(1) Changing defaults, so {} is now a local macro. The ExprMacro invokes
such a macro immediately, and returns the resulting value.

(2) The "independent" macro is now created as {* ... } where the star means
it can run anywhere. 

Updated Lib

(3) The local macro (or "code block") should run in a context that forwards 
lookups of parameters, but we must prevent outData.programContainsLooping() from
being global for the function. That means moving it into Ctx

(4) Moved it into Ctx, and added flag that stops propagation.

boolean programContainsLooping
boolean programContainsLoopingInfoStopsHere

Created method setProgramContainsLooping() and redirected calls from StmtLoop and StmtIterate.


Created Ctx.subContextForCodeBlock() which creates new sub-context same as sub() but
with separate OutData-object for collecting out(x). 


Seems to work.
</pre>

<h3>v1.0.6b 2020-06-29 Removed Net code</h3>
<p>
	Not in use, no clear idea of how it should work.
</p>
<p>
	Stored in CFT_Extra dir
</p>


<h3>v1.0.6 2020-06-29 Loops in macros</h3>
<p>
	Macros can now contain loops, but not the PIPE functionality.
</p>

<h3>v1.0.5 2020-06-27 ExternalScriptState - cached</h3>
<p>
	When calling function in external script, we want repeated calls to that same script to 
	reuse the same ObjGlobal. This is done by caching ExternalScriptState objects in
	ObjGlobal, allocated on a per-script basis.  
</p>
<pre>
	call "Lib:e" (savefile)
</pre>
<p>
	This means that the above code, which selects a favourite editor, and stores it in
	a ValDef, remembers this on the next call. Also, Input values and other data persisted
	to ObjGlobal are kept.
</p>
<p>
	Should an external script in turn call another external script, this gets cached internally
	in the same way, creating a tree of session states for external scripts.
</p>
<p>
	Updated doc on call expression and all over. Renamed macro mode from "global" to "independent".
</p>

<h2 style="color:blue">2020-06-27 project is "open source" on github</h2>



<h3>v1.0.4 2020-06-26 Modified if() expression</h3>
<p>
	The if() is modified so that when the selected expression resolves
	into a macro, it gets called automatically (once).
</p>


<h3>v1.0.4 2020-06-26 Added expression when()</h3>
<p>
	A simple implementation of multiple choice ("switch").
</p>
<pre>
	when (bool, expr)
</pre>
<p>
	When the first parameter is true, the expr is resolved. If it results in a macro (which is
	a value), then it is called automatically (once). If the boolean expression is false, 
	then the expression is never resolved, and instead null is returned.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.3b 2020-06-25 Fixed bug with CodeInlineDocument</h3>
<p>
	This was rewritten as part of file parsing 2020-06-21
</p>

<h3>v1.0.3 2020-06-24 Added global error() function</h3>
<p>
	Throws Exception, terminating code processing.
</p>


<h3>v1.0.2 2020-06-24 Added Lib.Sys</h3>
<p>
	The Sys object contains two functions: version() and functions()
</p>

<h3>v1.0.1 2020-06-23 cd improved</h3>
<p>
Changed so that if no direct match, cd uses one or more parts to match against 
available directories. This means one can enter one or more substrings of 
the target dir.
</p>

<h2 style="color:blue">2020-06-22 VERSION 1.0</h2>
<p>
	With the robustness added with regards to parsing script files and
	reporting errors, the versioning is changed from dates to numbers.
</p>

<p>
	Improved error reporting for interactive lines and defined functions when
	no script reload is done. Also fixed proper error reporting useing CodeLine.getSourceLocation()
	when Parser.parse() fails.
</p>



<h3>2020-06-21 SourceLocation improvement</h3>
<p>
	Using SourceLocation to report location in script file or
	"single line" just entered, or recently added but without script
	being reloaded (either manually or because of updates in editor).
	</p>
		

<h3>2020-06-21 File parsing / comments</h3>
<p>
	Fixed so that comments are processed correctly when executing code from file,
	by parsing the code as lines, instead of concatenating into a string which is
	then parsed.
	</p>
	
<p>
	Modified line editing command !x:marker!blabla to work only for 
	functions containing a single line of code
	</p>
	
<p>
	Also showing first non-blank line in function list '?', should perhaps contains
	a comment
	</p>
	
<h3>2020-06-14 Macro</h3>
<p>
	Created ExprMacro which is { Stmt* } and which when executed returns a
	ValueMacro object. This is a regular value, though not synthesizable, which
	can be stored in a variable or returned from a function,
</p>
<p>
	To call a macro, invoke the .call function on it, possibly with parameters,
	which are in turn picked up with the usual P() function.
</p>
<p>
	Macros come in two variants: local and global. A local macro has access
	to variables in the caller, and will redefine those when assigning, rather
	than create internal local variables. These macros
	are for internal use inside functions. This means that local variables inside
	the macro should be limited, as they have to be unique to avoid confusion.
</p>
<pre>
	{ &lt;- .... }
</pre>
<p>
	Global macros are scope-isolated macros that do not inherit anything from the caller 
	environment. They can be passed around as parameters, and called by anyone,
	without unfortunate side effects or errors due to missing symbols.
</p>
<pre>
	{ .... }           
</pre>
<p>
	Currently macros do not support loops or the PIPE character.
</p>
<h4>Example: automating data construction</h4>
<pre>
## Projects function
	{
		P(1)=name
		P(2)=path
		P(3)=types
	
		if(path.?trim, Dir(path), path) =path
		if(types.?trim, types.split, types) =types
	
		Dict.set("name",name).set("path",path).set("types",types)
	} =create
	#
	List(
		create.call("Project1", "xyz", "java"),
		create.call("Project2",  "c:\hub", "java txt")
	) 
/Projects
</pre>
<h4>Macros as parameters</h4>
<pre>
P(1,List)=options
P(2,{"name"})=macroGetElementName
	options-&gt;x
		println(macroGetElementName.call(x))
/ShowOptions

P(1,List)=options
P(2,{"name"})=macroGetElementName
	readLine("Enter part of name? ") =sel
	options-&gt;opt
		assert(macroGetElementName.call(opt).contains(sel))
		out(opt)
/SelectOptions
</pre>
<p>
	Here we see generic functions ShowOptions and SelectOptions, which are
	supplied a list of options, and a macro that is invoked on each
	item to produce a name.
</p>
<h4>Calling the above + extending if() expression</h4>
<pre>
Projects =p
	{
		" - " + P(1).get("name")
	} =macroGetElementName
	loop
		println("--------------------")
		println("Available projects")
		println("--------------------")

		ShowOptions (p, macroGetElementName)
		SelectOptions(p, macroGetElementName) =result
		false =breakOuter
		if (result.length==1, { 
			&lt;-
			ValDef("Project", result.nth)
			true =breakOuter
		}.call, 0)
		break(breakOuter)
		println("* Your selection gave " + result.length + " possible options")

/SelectProject
</pre>

<h3>2020-06-11 Added predicate calls: ".?"</h3>
<p>
	Instead of having to write predicate functions like String.isInt, there now
	is a modifier to dotted calls, and a new class DottedCall, invoked from ExprE.
</p>
<pre>
	"sdf".?parseInt
	&lt;boolean&gt;
  	false
</pre>
<p>
	This notation returns error string if there is an exception, otherwise boolean true. 
</p>
<p>
  The predicate calls can also be used to check if a function exists for a value, and
  in this way identify the type of a value, using identity functions, String.isString(), 
  List.isList() and so on. <b>TODO?</b>
</p>



<h3>2020-06-10 Added :NN</h3>
<p>
	Often one wants to access the n'th element of a result list, and ls(N) was created
	for this. Now created colon command, which checks if last result is a List, and then
	synthesizes the indicated element.
</p>
<pre>
	$ ls
	$ :0
</pre>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added Dir.runCapture() </h3>
<p>
	Created Dir.runCapture() which is a copy of Dir.run(), except that it captures output
	and returns a list with the output lines.
</p>
<p>
	The output lines are also sent to the screen, in case the external command asks the user
	for input. Curses-based programs like nano and top are not suited for .runCapture()
</p>

<pre>
	Dir.runCapture("ls")
</pre>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added List.empty() function</h3>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added Global.FileLine() function</h3>
<p>
	This enables full synthesize-functionality of FileLine, rather than inheriting the
	String class version, which is incomplete. Added and tested ValueObjFileLine synthesize()
	method.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-09 Added Version info</h3>
<p>
	Created Version.java class, displayed from Main
</p>

<h3>2020-06-09 fixed bug in String synthesize</h3>
<p>
	Force escaping when string contains newline, cr or tab
</p>

<h3>2020-06-08 P() default value fix</h3>
<p>
	Originally, the default value was only used if the number of parameters given was
	too short. Changed this so that giving null as positional parameter, means using
	the default, if any.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-08 PDict() expression</h3>
<p>
	Added PDict() under ExprTerminal. It takes a comma-separated list of strings, which are mapped to
	the function parameters by position, and returns a Dict object. If more names than
	actual parameters, the value null is stored in the Dict.
</p>
<p>
	The point is to simplify functions performing merging, which uses a dictionary. 
	Also changed the String.merge() function to replace value null with "" (and not just
	blindly getValAsString()).
</p>


<h3>2020-06-08 String.hash</h3>
<p>
	Added hash() function to string.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-08 File.hex \r\n\t</h3>
<p>
	Added detection for CR, LF and TAB, and displaying \r\n\t for those.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 negative index to List.nth</h3>
<p>
List.nth(-1) returns last element, .nth(-2) second last and so on
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 File.hex</h3>
<p>
Renamed from File.hexList, made interactive, fixed bug (omitting display of characters with ascii 127), and
added position col
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 CharTable</h3>
<p>
Code is used in MVRS, and fails for long strings due to stack overflow. Fixed and tested.
</p>

<h3>2020-06-07 println</h3>
<p>
Global function println
</p>


<h3>2020-06-05 assert/reject in loop</h3>
<p>
Code for checking for assert/reject logic was added for "loop" statement. 
</p>

<h3>2020-06-03 Command line arguments</h3>
<p>
	Renamed the ConfigTool start script to ./cft, and it now supports command line parameters.
	The first is the name of the script file, then follows zero or more strings that are
	executed as if they were regular input.
</p>

<h3>2020-05-24 New master Doc.html</h3>
<p>
The Overview.txt contains disposition of topics
</p>

<h3>2020-03-15 Net routing</h3>
<p>
Routing ok
</p>

<h3>2020-03-08 Net v2</h3>
<p>
Network module v2. Crypto ok. Ping ok.
</p>


<h3>2020-03-06 readLine(prompt)</h3>
<p>
	Reads single text line without any "remembering" previous values as Input does
</p>


<h3>2020-02-28 Stdio</h3>
<p>
	Internal change: created Stdio to replace presence of stdin, stdout and the buffer class
	for input text lines (programmed via stdin("xxx"))
</p>



<h3>2020-02-22 'here' documents</h3>
<p>
	Added notation for converting block of text in savefile to list of strings. 
</p>

<pre>
	&lt;&lt;&lt; marker
	line 1
	line 2
	&gt;&gt;&gt; marker
</pre>

<p>
	This is a source-file feature, not available in the interactive shell, which instead
	offers the function readLines(endMarker)
</p>

<h3>2019-12-20 Float()</h3>
<p>
	Following the template of Int() and Str(), for sorting floating point values
</p>

<h3>2019-11-07 File.readBytes()</h3>
<p>
	Added function readBytes on File object. Great for producing wave diagrams for sound
	recordings (signed).
</p>

<h3>2019-10-30 automatic refresh when savefile changed</h3>
<p>
	Editing files with editors, we now get immediate update
	when the save file is changed on disk.
</p>

<p>
	Keeping the ":load" without file name, though it is redundant.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-20 savefile</h3>
<p>
	Created global function savefile() which returns File object for current savefile.
</p>
<pre>
Dir.runDetach("leafpad",savefile.path)
</pre>


<h3>2019-10-19 List.push()</h3>
<p>
	Created "stack push" function for List, taking the following parameters:
</p>

<pre>
List.push(Count,Default?)
</pre>

<p>
	The Count is the number of elements we want pushed on the stack, and the Default is the
	value to use if list does not contain enough elements. The values can then be assigned
	to local variables in natural order.
</p>

<pre>
$ "x y".split.push(3,"*")=a=b=c a+":"+b+":"+c
  &lt;String&gt;
  x:y:* 
</pre>


<h3>2019-10-19 Dict properties as functions</h3>
<p>
	Setting properties with names that are identifies, that don't collide with existing
	functions, are added as dynamically generated functions, accessible via dotted notation.
</p>

<p>
	Dict.set("a",5)
	/x
	x.a  # gives 5
</p>

<h3>2019-10-18 Cfg.wrap() and :wrap</h3>
<p>
	Added wrap state to Cfg, settable via Cfg.wrap(boolean) and flippable via colon command ":wrap"
</p>

<h3>2019-10-18 Dir.showTree() function</h3>
<p>
	Added Dir.showTree(Dir, LimitKb?) which returns a list of lines with all directories
	under Dir, which contain files, and the sum of sizes of files in those directories is &gt;= LimitKb (defaults to 0). 
</p>

<p>
	Or one can use code
</p>

<pre>
+-----------------------------------------------------
| DFiles  : P(1,Dir)=d 0=n d.files-&gt;f f.length+n=n | n/1024=x ""+x+" kb"
| ShowTree: P(1,Dir).allDirs-&gt;d report(d.path, DFiles(d)) | _.sort
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .       : ShowTree
+-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<h3>2019-10-18 isWindows() function</h3>
<p>
	Returns boolean
</p>

<h3>2019-10-17 File.hexList</h3>
<p>
	Create File.hexList() which returns a list of strings displaying the
	content in hex for any file.
</p>


<h3>2019-10-17 cat</h3>
<p>
	Created statement "cat" which follows the format of "cd", in that it either
	takes (Expr) or eats the rest of the line, concatenates it and ends up with
	a file path, which is then dumped directly to output, line by line, no formatting.
</p>

<p>
	When successful, the cat statement puts the file as an ObjFile value on the
	stack.
</p>


<h3>2019-10-17 todo.txt</h3>
<p>
	Due to using text editors for modifying save files, there is no longer much point in
	creating advanced line editing functions. Even on a CLI one can always invoke "nano"
	or similar.
</p>

<p>
	Also, due to Dir.runDetach, the use of editors also reduce the need for 
	advanced File.more, as it is easier to search and page around in an editor. 
</p>


<h3>2019-10-16 Cfg.w / .getScreenWidth / Grep.file()</h3>
<p>
	Lines from files, must have TAB substituted with spaces. Using existing code
	written for File.more, moved it to rf.configtool.util.TabUtil, and
	now integrated it into Grep, for cleaner result lists still.
</p>
<p>
	Also added the same conversion on File.read, converting tabs to spaces, as 
	file reading is primarily about displaying data. Note that DataFile is not
	modified, as it is used to produce output files, and no conversion of tabs
	should take place there.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-15 Cfg.w / .getScreenWidth / displaying result</h3>
<p>
	Added code to respect this (Runtime.processInteractiveInput()), after making
	Report class return list of strings, rather than writing to stdout itself. 
</p>


<h3>2019-10-15 call() finalized</h3>
<p>
	The call statement is now the call expression, and its syntax is extended:
</p>

<pre>
	call "savefile:function" [ with(Dict) ] Params?
</pre>

<p>
	And it all works, and is a way to reuse code while overriding functions with values, 
	as long as those values can be synthesized into strings.
</p>

<pre>
+-----------------------------------------------------
| a   : 5
| b   : "hei"+a
| d   : Dict.set("a","xxx")
| test: call "test:b" with (d)
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .   : test
+-----------------------------------------------------
Current save name: test
$ test
  &lt;String&gt;
  heixxx 
$
</pre>

<p>
	The same mechanism will be handy when invoking from the command line, wrapping each
	value into ValueString, then synthesizing, to ensure valid code. 
</p>

<p>
	Implementation details:  rf.configtool.main.CallScriptFunc is the gateway.
</p>




<h3>2019-10-13 list becomes List</h3>
<p>
	The list function is renamed to List.
</p>

<p>
	To identify needed changes:
</p>
<pre>
$ Dir.files(Glob("savefile*"))-&gt;f Grep("list").file(f) -&gt;line out(line)
</pre>


<h3>2019-10-12 cd / ls</h3>
<p>
	As cd is used interactively, it was easy to fix it, just scanning the rest
	of the input, and concatenating a path string. Also eliminated the name "dir",
	and added two more names, so that
</p>

<ol>
	<li>"ls" - list of directories and files</li>
	<li>"lsf" - list of files</li>
	<li>"lsd" - list of directories</li>
</ol>


<h3>2019-10-06 savefile format</h3>
<p>
	Created v2 savefile format, which is readable and editable. It is identified
	by first line of file being #v2. Also modified '?' command to display code in
	the same order as in the save file. Multi-line code is supported on read, and 
	is preserved when saved, except for functions that have been changed. 
</p>

<p>
	But even for modified functions, we preserve original lines preceding the function,
	if such exist.
</p>

<p>
	Also modified updates so that the original order is maintained.
</p>

<p>
	And finally modified the ":load" command so that identifier is optional, except
	for the very first time, as reload after modifications to save file will now
	be required.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-01 debug</h3>
<p>
	Added statement debug(expr), to display text directly.
</p>

<h3>2019-10-01 loop / break</h3>
<p>
	Created loop statement, which loops forever, until break(true) is invoked. Note that
	break can also be applied when iterating over a list value with "expr-&gt;..."
</p>

<p>
	Created in anticipation of FileReader, which reads single lines from files, for 
	filtering huge log files.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-26 changed local variable scope rules</h3>
<p>
	Introduced java class FunctionState, which contains both function parameters, and
	all variables assigned via "=x". This allows for more logical constructs such as
	</p>

<pre>
	$ 0=sum list(1,2,3)->x sum+x =sum | sum   # <-- returns 6
</pre>

<h3>2019-09-15 global Cfg object</h3>
<p>
	Created Cfg object, available via global function by same name. It currently contains the 
	following variables:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>'h' - height of screen - default 24</li>
	<li>'w' - width of screen - default 130</li>
	<li>'wd' - wrap data output - default true</li>
	<li>'wm' - wrap more lines - default false</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Currently implemented</h4>
<ul>

	<li>the showCode() function - respects 'w'</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>2019-09-15 list.insert</h3>
<p>
	Added function insert(pos,val) on list, doing destructive modification on self().
</p>

<h3>2019-09-14 list.set</h3>
<p>
	Added function set(pos,val) on list, doing a destructinve modification on self()
</p>

<h3>2019-09-15 list.remove</h3>
<p>
	Added function remove(pos) on list, doing a destructive change on self(), constituting
	the opposite of add() which also modifies the instance itself (and which is important when
	using Val() to repeatedly refer to same object).
</p>

<h3>Manual entry - example</h3>
<p>
	Using readLines to paste in for example a netplan file, followed by a ":syn" to create an
	actual list value. Then use replace to replace for instance an IP address with a merge
	code.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-14 list.replace</h3>
<p>
	Added function replace(str1,str2) for the list value object. It traverses the list
	and reads each value as string, then replaces str1 with str2. Returns new list.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-14 readLines</h3>
<p>
	Added global function readLines(endmarker) which reads input lines until label found on separate line.
	Returns a list, which must be synthesized (with :syn) to be useful. Nice for creating a list
	of strings from a text file that is copy-pasted into the window, followed by manually
	entering the endmarker.
</p>
<p>
	2019-10-17 renamed from original name "cat", as "cat" is now used to list a file.
</p>



<h3>2019-09-04 Dir.run()</h3>

<p>
	Run external commands. Uses redirecting of stdin, stdout and stderr. This means
	we get to interact with external programs, but not buffer input via the stdin()
	mechanism. For that we must probably implement some threads.
</p>

<pre>
	$ Dir.run("ls")
	$ Dir.run("ls","-l")
	$ list("ls","-l")
	$ /cmd
	$ Dir.run(cmd)
</pre>

<h3>2009-09-04 File.move()</h3>
<p>
	Implemented .move(File) to rename and/or move a file. Returns self or throws
	Exception. 
</p>

<h3>2009-09-04 Dict.setStr() and .mergeCodes()</h3>

<p>
	Added setStr() function to Dict, which parses string on format "xxx : yyy" or "xxx = yyy", and
	puts value "yyy" in dictionary under key "xxx" (both trimmed).
</p>

<p>
	Also added function mergeCodes() that returns copy where all keys are modified into ${key},
	for use as merge codes.
</p>

<h3>2019-09-04 DataFile upgrades</h3>

<p>
	DataFile supports comment lines to be excluded.
</p>

<pre>
	$ DateFile(File("x.txt"),"###").comment(";")
	$ /df
</pre>

<h3>2019-09-02 Dict.get default value</h3>

<p>
	Added optional default value for Dict.get(name), so that when no value is found for name,
	the default value is added to the dictionary, under the given name, and then returned.
</p>

<p>
	This enables compact code:
</p>

<pre>
	$ P(1,Dict)=d d.get("lines",list).add("hello")
</pre>

<h3>2019-09-02 Session Values</h3>

<p>
	Created two global functions, for maintaining session values. These let us instantiate
	a Dict or list object that does not go away until explicitly reset, which can be
	referred via simple code:
</p>

<pre>
	$ ValDef("x",list)
	$ /Init

	$ Val("x")
	$ /x

	$ x.add(1)
	$ x.add(2)
	$ x.sum
	  3
</pre>

<p>
	Persistent values can are cleared by redefining them to null, which is the default
	value when trying to get a value that doesn't exist.
</p>

<pre>
	$ ValDef("x",list)
</pre>


<h3>2019-09-02 String .esc and .unEsc</h3>
<p>
	Needed a more robust synthesize method for strings, so added two functions to String, which
	escapes all dangerous characters (even including space) and the reverse function. 
</p>

<p>
	Changed the synthesize method of ValueString, so that when string contains both types of quotes,
	it returns the escaped string in regular quotes, followed by .unEsc, thus generating code 
	that restores the actual string.
</p>


<h3>2019-06-28 Input history</h3>

<p>
	Added history over the last 100 entered values, accessed via
</p>

<pre>
	:       -- list numbered options
	:N      -- use numbered option
	::sdf   -- text starting with colon
</pre>



<h3>2019-06-25 Remote Server and Client</h3>
<p>
	Created a remote server that listens to a port, and a remote client that
	connects to a remote server on an address and port. Currently no 
	gentle way of leaving the connection, but apart from that it works
</p>

<pre>
	Net.RemoteServer(2500).init

	Net.RemoteClient("localhost",2500).connect

	[localhost] $
</pre>

<p>
	TODO
</p>

<ol>
	<li>put connection into the background, where it receives output and buffers it
	internally, to be displayed later when put into foreground</li>
	<li>Need a way of regaining control of the local process, f.ex via command ":local"</li>
	<li>Must also have a way of displaying connections, closing connections and activating background connection</li>
	<li>Running connections in the background gives us a multitasking ability with, when
		connecting localhost and running code there
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>2019-06-18 uncompress compressed files</h3>
<p>
	Added File.uncompress(targetDir). Using old FileInfo class. It is not sophisticated, but it
	solved a problem. Copies uncompressed files unchanged
</p>

<h3>2019-05-31 Lib.Net</h3>
<p><b>2019-06-25: moved to GlobalObj</b></p>
<p>
	Want to use ConfigTool to push data over networks, possibly extending to full
	remote control. Added the following functions, which allows us to set up a server
	listening on a TCP server port, and using a client to push files over the network
	to such servers. 
</p>

<pre>
	Net.PushServer(2500).init    # sets up tcp server on port 2500

	Net.PushClient("127.0.0.1",2500)  # creates client
	/c

	c.push(File)
	c.push(File,"targetName")
	c.remoteDir("xxx")
</pre>

<h3>2019-05-30 Grep takes regex</h3>

<p>
	Added two functions to Grep: matchRegex(re) and rejectRegex(re)
</p>

<h3>2019-05-30 String matching</h3>
<p>
	Added functions for locating substrings
</p>

<pre>
	"abcd".before("c")
	"ab"

	"abcd".after("b")
	"cd"

	"abcd".between("a","d")
	"bc"

	"abbb".beforeLast("b")
	"abb"

	"aaab".afterLast("a")
	"b"
</pre>

<h3>2019-04-04 Regex handling</h3>
<p>
	Created class Regex under runtime.lib, with a single static method for building RegEx from strings. Using
	this method from <i>ObjGlob</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Also modified inner workings of old class <i>ObjFilter</i> to build internal list of RE's, using Regex class. This allows
	for more sophisticated filtering, as multiple contains("xxx") operate with logical AND between them, 
	plus that Filter has support for case sensitive on/off. Added method for adding RE directly.
</p>

<p>
	<i>TODO: upgrade ObjGrep to use RE's internally?</i>
</p>

<h3>2019-03-22 syn() function</h3>
<p>
	In preparation for creating multiline scripts, as well as for general flexibility, I've added
	the global syn() function, which takes a synthesizable value, and returns as a string the code
	that creates it. If the value can not be synthesized, an error is reported.
</p>

<p>
	Also added String.indexOf() function for improved parsing.
</p>


<h3>2019-02-17 Function.java </h3>

<p>
	(2019-03-13 updated)
</p>

<p>
	As part of creating a Gui class which should contain interactivity, we needed to extend the callFunction()
	of the Function class, as invoked from LookupOrCall.resolve(). Created a parallel method, called callFunctionNew(), 
	which by default calls the callFunction() method, which is now defined in Function.java throwing exception.
</p>

<p>
	The callFunctionNew() takes Ctx object instead of TextIn and TextOut, which are anyway direct properties of the
	Ctx object. 
</p>

<p>
	Also extended the CommandProcessor interface to include the method processProgramLine.
</p>

<p>
	In sum this makes it possible to create code that executes code. The first example is the Gui.button("name","code"), which
	when having its "clicked" function called, executes the "code", using the CommandProcessor.processProgramLine() method. This
	method returns a value, which becomes the return value from the clicked() method. This of course exemplifies how an
	eval("str") function should work.
</p>

<p>
	So obviously eval(str) was the next to be created.
</p>

<p>
	2019-03-17 Never got the GUI to work, so deleted it.
</p>

<h3>2019-02-17 ObjPersistent</h3>
<p>
	After creating Gui.show, which displays a graphical interface, a method for killing that window on exit was needed. 
</p>
<p>
	This was done by extending
	the ObjPersistent class with a method cleanupOnExit(), which for ObjGui performs a dispose on the App object. Also added identically named method to ObjGlobal, and a call to that from Main on exit.
</p>
<p>
	Also added method initPersistentObj() which is called once for each persisted instance. Added this method to the Gui object (ObjGui),
	as a way of popping up the JFrame after it has been created and recognized as the first Gui object. Later calls to Gui which returns
	objects with persistence-id matching an existing object are thrown away, and replaced by the persisted object.
</p>


<h3>2019-03-13 showCode()</h3>
<p>
	Added wildcard '*' option at end of name matches.
</p>

<p>
	Example: showCode("DirCurr,Dir*:Config|S*:Search|*:The rest")
</p>

<p>
	The point of DirCurr before Dir* is to ensure DirCurr is displayed before other Dir* whatever their alphabetical order.
</p>

- Fixed int parse problem, now parsing as long
- String.parseFloat
- String.replace

---------------
- Allow multiple programlines to be added on a single
line, separated by the pipe symbol, and using the "_"

-> returns xy when declared
/F

F("a")
-> returns "ay"
