# ConfigTool - CFT


**Last updated: 2020-07-08 RFO**

**v1.0.14**
# Introduction


ConfigTool (CFT) is a "programmers tool", in the form of a Java application that runs in a
terminal window. It has no graphical
elements, which means it can run everywhere. From the start it has been developed
as an interactive environment, with strong emphasis on automation. The syntax is compact,
in the interest of getting useful work out of even a single line of code.


CFT has been routinely used on Linux and Windows, and easily integrates with external commands
on both. It should run everywhere that supports Java.


Development has been going on since May 2018, and was assigned v1.0 as robustness and error
handling had reached a certain level, and was then made open source on github. It started
out purely as an interactive
tool, with emphasis on terse syntax, since all code was entered via the command line. After
a while it evolved into editing the savefiles, or "script files".


Functionality has been driven partially by needs and partially by what's fun to implement.

# CFT as a shell

## Navigating directories


CFT started out as an interactive shell-like app. It runs in a terminal window, and offers a simple '$' prompt, where one enters commands.

```
$ ls
$ cd subdir
$ cd ..
$ pwd
```
### Listing files or directories only

```
$ lsf
$ lsd
```

The "ls" function as well as it sibling functions "lsd" and "lsf", can take an int argument,
which makes them return the element identified by the value.


Example:

```
$ ls
<list>
0: .git/       | d:6   | f:5
1: build/      | d:1   | f:0
2: doc/        | d:1   | f:4
3: lib/        | d:0   | f:2
4: src/        | d:2   | f:2
5: .gitignore  | 0k    | 18      | 84d | 2020-02-28 21:25:26
6: TODO.txt    | 7k    | 7367    |     | 2019-08-15 22:28:46
```
## Show content of file


Now if we want to list content of file "TODO.txt", we can enter

```
$ ls(6).read
```

Likewise, if we want to change current directory to the "doc" subdirectory, we can enter

```
$ cd(ls(2))
```

Alternatively we could also write

```
$ File("TODO.txt").read
$ cd doc
```
# The help system


To get information about what global functions are available, type "help" and press Enter. A list of global
functions is displayed with a short description for each. To get help for functions available inside an
object, put an object of that type on the stack followed by help.

```
$ help
$ "" help
$ Dir help
$ 3 help
$ 0.1 help
```

The first produces a list of global functions, the second of functions inside string objects, and
the third displayes the functions inside Dir objects. The fourth lists functions available on
int, and the last for float values.

# Base functions and objects: File, Dir and List


CFT is a programming language, with an interactive front-end,
and offers a number of built-in functions, which produce objects
with member functions and so on. The most important
objects types are 
**File** and 
**Dir**, plus 
**List**.

## File() function

```
$ File("x.txt")
<obj: File>
x.txt   DOES-NOT-EXIST
```

The File() function requires a name, and returns a File object. As seen
above, the file needs not exist (yet).


The files created in this way are always located in
the CFT home directory. This gives predictability for (system) data files etc.
To access or create files in other directories:

```
$ SomeDirExpression.file("x.txt")
```
### Create file


To create a file with a single text line:

```
File("x.txt").create("one line")
```

If the file already exists, it is overwritten with the new content.

### Read file


To read an existing text file:

```
File("x.txt").read
```

This returns a list of all lines in the file.

### Append to file


To append a single line to a file:

```
File("x.txt").append("another line")
```

To append multiple lines, append a list instead.

### Page through a file


To page through text file

```
File("x.txt").more
```
### Show bytes of file


To page through list of bytes (hex)

```
File("x.txt").hex
```
### Encoding


Default encoding is "ISO_8859_1", but this can be changed, for example:

```
File("x.txt").setEncoding("UTF-8")
```
## Dir() function

```
$ Dir
<obj: Dir>
ConfigTool/ d:5 f:20
```

Calling the Dir function with no parameters returns a Dir object for the current directory. The Dir
object offers multiple member functions, one of which is 
**files**, which produces a list of files in
the directory. We can also call the Dir function with a path parameter.

### Create a subdirectory

```
Dir.sub("someDir").create
```
### Parent directory


ATo get the parent directory of a Dir object, we use:

```
Dir.sub("..")
```
### Get files in a directory

```
Dir.files
```
### Create a file in a directory

```
Dir.file("x.txt").create("something")
```
### Get directories in a directory

```
Dir.dirs
```
### Get all files recursively under a directory

```
Dir.allFiles
```

To get all directories recursively under a directory:

```
Dir.allDirs
```
### Delete a sub-directory


The sub-directory must be empty

```
Dir.sub("something").delete
```
## Lists


The List object is essential for all data processing in CFT. Calling Dir.files() function
produces a list of File objects.

```
$ Dir.files
<list>
0: someFile.txt    | 0k    | 777     | 90d | 2020-02-22 16:38:53
1: otherFile.txt   | 1k    | 1250    | 49d | 2020-04-03 10:02:44
:
```

Many functions are available on a List object. One frequently used is "nth", which
gets a specific element, defaulting to 0 if no argument.

```
$ List("a","b","c").nth
<String>
a
```

For details of available functions, as always use the help system:

```
$ List help
```

To create file with multiple lines:

```
File("x.txt").create(List("line1","line2","line 3"))
```
### List addition


Two lists can be added together with "+".

```
List(1,2) + List(3)
<list>
1
2
3
```
# The shell() function


The global shell() function starts a shell inside CFT. When you exit from it, you're back
in CFT.

```
$ shell
(starts bash or cmd or Powershell or something else)
exit
# Running /usr/bin/bash completed: 25529ms
$
```
# Core types



- String


- int - (Java long)


- float - (Java double)


- boolean


- List



All values in CFT are objects, which may contain functions. Strings can be written using double
or single quotes.

## String literals


Strings are written in single or double quotes, and can be summed with '+', which allows
for all kinds of combinations.

```
$Â "'a'"
<String>
'a'
$ '"' + "'a'" + '"'
<String>
"'a'"
```

Also, there is no escape character, which means backslash is just another character.

# List processing


Lists are essential for all processing with CFT.


Lists can be created manually using the global List() function.

```
$ List(1,2,3)
$ List("a","b","c")
```

A much used way for creating lists of strings, is to use the string function split(), which by default
splits a string on spaces. This means the following produce the same result.

```
$ List("a","b","c")
$ "a b c".split
```
## Iterating over list content


The iterator in CFT takes the form of an arrow followed by a loop variable. For a loop construct
to return output, we use the out() statement inside.

```
$ "1 2 3".split->x out("a"+x)
<list>
0: a1
1: a2
2: a3
```

The result is a list of strings, as displayed.

## Filtering with assert(), reject() and break()


Using the assert() statement, we may abort processing for elements that do not meet a condition.

```
$ Dir.allFiles->f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
```

The reject() statement is the inverse of assert(), and aborts processing for elements that meet
a certain condition.

```
$ List(1,2,3,2,1)->x reject(x>2) out(x)
<list>
1
2
2
1
```

The break() statement terminates the loop if the condition is true.

```
List(1,2,3,2,1)->x break(x>2) out(x)
<List>
1
2
```
## The condOut() statement


In addition to controlling loops with assert/reject and break, there is the condOut()
statement, which takes a boolean condition as first parameter, and the value to
be sent out as second parameter. Can be useful some times.

# Creating custom functions

## Creating a function


When some code does what we want, we typically create a function from it. This is done by entering

```
... (some code) ...
/name
```

This assigns the name "name" to the last line, and we have now created a custom function.

```
$ Dir.allFiles-> f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
$ /JavaFiles
```
## Calling a function


To call the above function, just enter its name.

```
JavaFiles
```
## Listing custom functions


Enter '?' and press Enter.

```
$ ?
+-----------------------------------------------------
| JavaFiles: Dir.allFiles->f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .        : Dir.allFiles->f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
+-----------------------------------------------------
```

Here we see function 'JavaFiles' and its code. We also see the last entered code line, with
a dot '.' in front of it. The last code line is the one that can be given a name, and further,
the last code line can be repeated by entering a single dot and pressing enter.

## Savefiles


To save all named functions, enter the special command below

```
$ :save Test
```

This creates a file under the "code.work" directory, found in the CFT home directory,
called savefileTest.txt. To load it:

```
$ :load Test
```
## CFT.props - codeDirs


The CFT.props file contains the following line by default

```
codeDirs = . ; code.examples ; code.lib
```

The codeDirs field defines a search order when loading scripts.
The first directory is 
**always** used when you type ":save".


The code.examples contains some example code for various use, while code.lib contains
library code, used by most other scripts.


This means you are free to save a script using the name "Lib", and it will be written to
the code.work directory. Doing this means it will hide the version in the code.lib directory.
Which may be perfectly fine, as long as it is what you intended.

# CFT as a functional programming language

## Code only


A major point of CFT is that when we define names using "/name", these names are functions, which
mean they point to code. When entering code, it is immediately executed, leaving us with a result. When we are happy with the outcome, we may assign a name to the function.


The point is that it is the function code that is named, not the result.

```
$ "1 2 3".split
<list>
0: 1
1: 2
2: 3
$ /data
```

Entering the "/data" command
assigns a name to the last code line, not the data it returned. Every reference to the
custom function "data" will now run the code over again, and produce (the same) result.


Entering '?' to list your defined functions, you see this clearly.

```
$ ?
+-----------------------------------------------------
| data: "1 2 3".split
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .   : "1 2 3".split
+-----------------------------------------------------
```
## Local variables


The inside of a function may use local variables for simplifying expressions etc. Variable
assignment is "stack based", in that it is the current value from the stack that is assigned
to the local variable.

```
$ 3 =a 2 =b a+b
<int>
5
```
## Stack vs expressions


It is worth noting that even though CFT uses a data stack, expressions are not stack-based.
This is because  writing postfix expressions is too bothersome (ex. "3 2 +"), so CFT
parses expressions using regular infix notation ("3+2").

## Nested loops


Loops are implemented using the "for each" functionality of "-> var". Loops may well be nested.

```
$ List(1,2,3)->x List(1,2,3)->y  out(x*y)
<list>
0: 1
1: 2
2: 3
3: 2
4: 4
5: 6
6: 3
7: 6
8: 9
```

It is worth noting that in this case, the body of each loop is all code following the "-> var"
construct. But this can be changed using the "pipe" symbol, which "closes" all loops.

## The PIPE symbol


First a non-pipe example.


If we wanted to sum the sizes of all files in a directory, we could do it like this:

```
$ Dir.files->f out(f.length)
:
: (output)
:
$ /sizes
$ sizes.sum
<int>
999
$ /sizeSum
```

This works using the "sum" function on the List object that is the output
of the function "sizes".

## "Pipes" and code blocks


The "pipe" symbol '|' can be used to combine these two. What a "pipe" does, is providing
an end point for all current loops, waiting for them to complete, and produce their output.
That output is then put on top of the stack, available for the next section of code to work
with, or to do something else.


To avoid having to define a local variable just to grab one element off the stack, the special
variable name '_' pops the top value off the data stack.

```
$ Dir.files-> out(f.length) | _.sum
$ /sizeSum
```

We call the different parts of code separated by "pipe" symbols 
**code blocks**.


Often the output from a set of loops will be used in the next part, but that's
not always the case, usually when we want our function to return a non-list value.
There is a simple rule deciding what is taken as the return value of any block of
code separated by the "pipe" symbol (below).

```
$ 0 =sum Dir.files->f sum+f.length =sum | sum
```

This code returns an int, not a list, where as the "sizes" function above returned a list.

### Terminates all loops


Note that if there are nested loops, the "pipe" symbol terminates all these, not
just the innermost.

## Result value from code blocks


The return value of a function is the result value of the last code block,
with multiple code blocks being separated by the "pipe" symbol.


For a block of code the result value is decided as follows:



- If the code block contains loop statements, the result is
a list of data generated via "out()" or "report()" statements. If no actual iterations
take place, or filtering mean that "out()" never get called, the result is an empty list.


- If the code block does not contain loops, the output is the topmost value on the data stack.


## Function parameters


Custom functions can also take parameters. This is done using the P() statement, which
identifies the parameter by position, and allows a default value. The default value is important
for two reasons. First it allows the function code to execute while being developed interactively,
and second it may act as documentation, as an example of expected value.


Here we make an improved version of the JavaFiles function, that takes a directory parameter, and if none given, uses the current directory.

```
$ P(1,Dir) =dir dir.allFiles->f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
:
: (code result)
:
$ /JavaFiles
```

As this function body is entered, and executed, it runs on current directory, since
the default value for parameter 1 is "Dir". When calling the function without parameters,
the current directory is always used, but we can now direct it to returns java files from
a specific directory.

```
$ Dir("/home/user/project1")
$ /DirProject1
$ Dir("/home/user/project2")
$ /DirProject2
$ DirProject1
$ /CurrProject
$ JavaFiles(CurrProject)->f out(f.length) | _.sum
$ /JavaCodeSum
```

Now we have a function JavaCodeSum which calculates the sum total of all Java files
in a directory defined as CurrProject. To change project, all we have to do
is redefine CurrProject to refer to another project.

```
$ DirProject2
$ /CurrProject!
```

Note: when redefining a currently existing named function, we need to add '!' to indicate that
we want to override the old definition. Now when we run JavaCodeSum, it works on the
java files under project 2.

# Conditional execution


Conditional execution in CFT takes two basic forms.

## List filtering


The assert() and reject() statements inside loops decide if the rest of the loop body is to
be executed or not.

## if() expression


The if() statement takes three parameters, the condition, the if-expression, and the
else-expression. Depending on the condition only one of the two following expressions
are resolved.


In this example we call SomeFunction, then use an if() expression to replace return value 'null'
with a Dict object.

```
SomeFunction(...) =a
if(a==null, Dict, a) =a  # provides a default value if a is null
```
## when() expression


The when() expression is like an if() expression minus the else-part.

```
if (bool, expr)
```

If the boolean expression resolves to true, then the 'expr' is resolved, and this becomes the return
value. Otherwise, the 'expr' is not resolved, and the return value is null.


The when() expression is the best way of expression multiple-choice conditionals ("switch" in Java).

```
when (mode==1, SomeFunction(...))
when (mode==2, SomeOtherFunction(...))
when (mode==3, ... )
```
# Block expressions


An important feature is the concept of block expressions. These are sequences of code
inside curly braces, and are frequently used with if() and when().

```
false =ok
when (someCondition, {
println("hello there")
true =ok
})
```
## Block expressions are real expressions


Even though mostly used with when() and if(), block expressions are general expressions, just
like a function call, or some variable lookup.

```
{2+3}.bin
<String>
00000101
```
## Pitfalls


Even though block expressions occur literally inside other code, and have their variable scope
extend out into the calling environment, they are still somewhat function-like. This means:



- One can not pass data to or from block expressions via the stack, as they operate their
own stack internally


- Loop control does not extend from inside a block expressions to the surrounding code, partially
because block expressions can have their own loops. This means that
for example calling break(true) has no effect on the caller.



Example:

```
"a b c".split->x
when(x=="b", {break(true)})  # does not break loop
```

This break() does not affect the loop running outside the block expression.

# Running external programs

## Summary


The functions for running external programs are part of the Dir object, implicitly defining
working directory for the program.

```
$ Dir.run ( list|...)
$ Dir.runCapture ( list | ...)
$ Dir.runDetach ( list|...)
$ Dir.runProcess ( stdinFile, stdoutFile, stdErrFile, list|... )
```

The parameters written as "list|..." means either a List object, or a list of
String values, separated by comma.

## Dir.run()


This command is used for running external programs in the foreground. What this means is that if
the program requires user input, we can give it, and the CFT code will not continue until
the external process has terminated.

```
$ Dir.run("cmd","/c","git","pull","origin","master")
```

Many Windows programs require the "cmd","/c" in front. Notepad is an exception.
For proper operating systems (Linux) you naturally skip the two first elements of the command list.


Often it is easier to use String.split in this case, as Dir.run() accept a single List value
instead of multiple string parameters.

```
Dir.run("cmd /c git pull origin master".split)
```
## Dir.runCapture()


This works the same as Dir.run(), but returns a List of strings representing stdout from the
external program, to be processed further.

```
Dir.run("which","leafpad") =lines lines.length>0 && lines.nth.contains("leafpad")
/HasLeafpad
```

Note that though this function shows output from the external program, this is done line by line,
which will mess up programs using cursor positioning, such as "nano" and "top".

## Dir.runDetach()


Use to run external program in the background. The CFT code continues running after forking
off the background process.

```
$ Dir.runDetach("notepad", savefile.path)
```

This example runs notepad in the background, with the path of the current savefile as
argument.

## Dir.runProcess()


Similar to Dir.runDetach(), but for cases where we need to inspect the output, as this command
sets the external program up to read input from an input file, and redirect both stdout and
stderr to different files (File objects).

# Editing save files

## Using editor for entering code


As was illustrated above, in the case of Dir.runDetach(), we can create a function that opens
the current savefile in an editor. This of course requires a current savefile, which is created
by colon command save. The savefile internal function returns a File object for the savefile,
which we use to create full path argument to notepad.

```
$ :save Test
$ Dir.runDetach("notepad", savefile.path)
:
: (Notepad pops up, just close it immediately)
:
$ /e
$ :save
```

Now, calling function 'e', by just typing 'e' and pressing Enter, will open the current
savefile ("script file") in notepad.


Alernatively, on linux we may start leafpad or gedit instead of notepad, or if running in a
terminal-only environment, we may choose to run nano, using Dir.run() instead of .runDetach(),
so as to connect stdin and stdout correctly.

```
$ Dir.run("nano", savefile.path)
```
## Auto reload


After modifying a script in an editor, and saving it, CFT automatically reloads it the next
time you run something.

## No auto save!


Note that when modifying a script from within CFT, by defining or redefining functions, there
is 
**no auto save**. This is to allow experimentation without making changes permanent,
but requires that you remember to save manually when done.


If you have never saved the script, you must enter a name:

```
$ :save SomeName
```

Having saved the script before, you need only enter the following:

```
$ :save
```
## Losing changes


Doing changes to a script inside CFT, but forgetting to save, then opening an editor, which
naturally reads the savefile, then saving in the editor, means the initial changes done
interactively are lost.

## Multi-line functions


Editing the script file lets us write more complex functions. The save file supports
multi-line functions. The same rules apply as for single lines, regarding scope rules, which
means loops and loop termination using the "pipe" symbol.


Note: the "pipe" still terminates all nested loops.

## Comments


The hash character '#' indicates that the rest of the line is a comment.

## First line of function ...


The interactive command '?' is used to see the defined functions. For functions entered
interactively there is only one line, and that line is shown. For multiline functions,
the first line is displayed.


Letting the first line of a multi-line function be a comment is a great way of
producing meaningful content for the interactive '?' command.

## Debug


When creating complex code, we may need to display debug output. This is done with the global
debug() function, or you can use the println() function.

```
$ debug("data")
%DEBUG% data
```
# Interactive use

## Change current directory


The "cd" command should function mostly as expected. CFT has no autocomplete feature, since
it only reads lines, not key-presses.

### Direct sub-directory: use partial name


Changing to a direct sub-directory, you need not type the entire name, just enough to make
it unique. You can even supply multiple parts, and the sub-directory that contains all
those strings, is selected.


Imagine you have three directories LongProjectA, LongProjectB and LongProjectC, and the
names A, B and C are used elsewhere, you could write:
```
$ cd Pr B
```
### Change drive letter in Windows


The following is used to switch drive letter in Windows.

```
$ cd d:\
```
### Paths with space


Also note, that paths with space in them need to be put into
quotes.

```
$ cd "c:\Program Files\blah\blah"
```
## Listing files


The "ls" command comes in three variants:



-  "ls" - lists directories and files


-  "lsd" - lists directories only


-  "lsf" - lists files only



What "ls" can not do is globbing. Instead, when you need globbing, you can type

```
$ Dir.files(Glob("*.txt"))
```

The reason for this limitation, is that "ls" and its cousins are expressions. That's what
makes it possible to say:

```
$ cd(ls(2))
```
## Get data from user: Input() and readLine()


To stop and ask the user to enter something, we got two options. The Input() function
produces an Input object which maintains a
session state, remembering earlier values, and suggesting the last value input as default,
with the ability to show earlier values.


You need to call the ".get()" function on the Input object to actually ask the user to enter
data.


The readLine() function just pauses and reads a line. Both Input() and readLine() take a
prompt parameter. For Input objects, the session state remembering previous inputs, is
tied to the prompt string.

```
$ Input("Enter search text").get =text
$ readLine("Enter name") =name
```
## Searching files / report()


To search files, we usually use the Grep object. It takes a list of alternatives to look for,
and can optionally be instructed with patterns to reject. It has a .file(File) function that
runs the search on a file, and returns a list of lines that meet the requirements.


But the lines returned from "Grep.file()" are not
just strings, they are extended strings, of a type called "FileLine". It contains
two additional additional functions, "file()" to get the
file object and "lineNumber()" which returns the line number in that file.

### FileLine


The function "File.read()" also returns a list of FileLine objects, and not just strings.
A FileLine object can be created with global function FileLine().

```
$ FileLine("",1,File("x.txt")) help
```

This lists all the functions of the String type, plus the two mentioned above, "file()" and
"lineNumber()".

### report()


We already know that iterative loops can generate output using out(), but there is a second way,
which is the report() statement. It can take one or more parameters, and results in a list of strings that
are formatted into columns, for readability.


The formatted text is added to the same list of output as data via out(), but after the
code block has completed. This means that the formatted output from report() is data,
just like values from out().

### Multi-line example


Below we will show a multi-line example function, which we create editing the savefile,
that asks the user for a search text, then searches
some directory for all source files (java), and look for the pattern in each. The result is presented
in readable format, using report()

```
Dir("/home/user/project1")
/ProjectDir
Input("Enter search term").get =st
Grep(st) =grep
ProjectDir.allFiles->f
assert(f.name.endsWith(".java"))
grep.file(f)->line
report(line.file.name, line.lineNumber, line)
/Search
```

After adding the text to the script file using an editor, save it, then run Search in the
CFT terminal window.

```
$ Search
Enter search term
class
<list>
0: ProgramLine.java       | 11  | public class ProgramLine extends LexicalElement {
1: StmtDebug.java         | 9   | public class StmtDebug extends Stmt {
2: ExprIf.java            | 9   | public class ExprIf extends LexicalElement {
3: LexicalElement.java    | 5   | public class LexicalElement {
:
:
```
### Grep.lines()


To match content from a list instead of from file, the "Grep.lines()" function takes
a list of strings.

## Searching multiple types of file


To search multiple types of files, we create a function that creates a list of
valid types after the last dot, then check if the ending of the file matches one of
those.

```
"java txt".split
/FileTypes
Input("Enter search term").get =st
Grep(st) =grep
ProjectDir.allFiles->f
f.name.afterLast(".").toLower =ending
assert(FileTypes.contains(ending))
grep.file(f)->line
report(line.file.name, line.lineNumber, line)
/Search
```
## Searching log files / DateSort


Lines written to log files often will start with date and time. Further, actions that we want to
trace may span several log files, for example when messages are sent between different services,
each with its own log. To clearly trace such activity, we search the log files for some text,
and then sort the lines on the date/time at the start of each line.


A custom function / object has been created for this purpose, to make it easy to use.

```
Input("Enter search term").get =st
Grep(st)=grep
ProjectDir.allFiles->f
assert(FileQualified(f))
grep.file(f)->line
out(line)
|
=lines
DateSort.asc(lines)->line
report(line.file.name, line.lineNumber, line)
/SearchLog
```
## Generalized sorting


The List object has a function sort(), which does one of two things:



- if the list contains only numbers (int or float or a mix), sorts them by number value


- ... otherwise, sort as strings



The result is a new list. To sort in reverse order, we just apply the function ".reverse()"
on the finished list.


The trick to sorting is to 
**make all types of objects to be sorted into a number or a string**.


This is done by three wrapper functions called "Int()", "Float()" and "Str()". They create objects that
are subclasses of the regular int, float and
string types, but also contain a "data" member that can be extracted after sorting, via the ".data()"
function.

### Example: file size


Let's sort the files in the current directory so that the biggest files are listed first.

```
$ Dir.files->f out(Int(f.length,f)) | _.sort.reverse->x out(x.data)
```

For each file, we output an Int wrapper object, with value set to file length, and data
pointing to the file. The resulting list is sorted, reversed, then iterated to output
the data values, which are the original File object.


Could also sort on time, as File.lastModified is another int value, with CFT int values
corresponding to long in Java.

### Example: file name


To sort on file names, we use the Str() wrapper function / object.

```
$ Dir.files->f out(Str(f.name,f)) | _.sort-> out(x.data)
```
## Dictionary objects / Dict()


When working with multiple projects, or sources of log files, we want to quickly flip
between directories, file types and perhaps other settings. This is done using dictionary
objects.


Dictionary objects are key-value stored, like Map in Java.


Maintaining these types structures is best done when editing the script file with an editor.

```
Dict
.set("dir",Dir("/home/user/project1"))
.set("types","java txt".split)
/Project1
Dict
.set("dir",Dir("/home/user/project2"))
.set("types","js css html".split)
/Project2
Project1
/CurrProject
```

Now we can build code that searches files and performs other operations on CurrProject.


Switching between projects is done by redefining the CurrProject function.
```
$ Project2
$ /CurrProject!
```

To get a named value from a Dict object, use the get(name) function.

```
$ Dict.set("a",23).get("a")
<int>
23
```
## Date and time processing

### Milliseconds


If we want to produce a list of files modified within the last 30 minutes, we can do this
easily, using the global function currentTimeMillis, and the File.lastModified function.

```
Dir.files->f assert(currentTimeMillis-f.lastModified>30*60*1000) out(f)
/FilesModifiedLast30Minutes
```
### The Date object


The Date() function can be invoked without parameters, producing a Date object that represents
current date and time, or it can be called with an int value, which is milliseconds, such as
that returned from File.lastModified. Functions exist to decide if a date is before or after
another date, as well as for accessing individual properties, such as year, day of month, and so
on.


To list all files that were changed between two date/times now becomes easy

```
P(1,Date)=fromDate
P(2,Date)=toDate
Dir.files->f
Date(f.lastModified) =fileDate
assert(fileDate.after(fromDate) && fileDate.before(toDate))
out(f)
/FilesBetweenDates
```
### The Date.Duration object


The Date object in turn contains a function Duration() which creates a Date.Duration object. This
is both output from Date.diff, which calculates the amount of time between two dates, and used
as input to the Date.add and Date.sub functions, which are used to calculate other dates.


Example: calculating the date (and time) 300 days ago

```
$ Date.Duration.days(300) =x Date.sub(x)
```
## Session persistent data / ValDef / Val


When working interactively with large sets of data, we have the option of saving those
data into a session persistent data store. Two global functions let us define
a named value, and access it.

```
$ ValDef("a",12)
$ Val("a")
<int>
12
```

Being tied to the session, these data are lost when quitting CFT.

## Synthesis

### The problem


If we use "cd" and "ls" to move
to a directory, and want to create a function that works on files or subdirectories under
that location, we have to take care.


The issue is that we can not just say

```
Dir.allFiles->f ...
```

... because the Dir() function returns the current directory, which may change.

### Creating code from values


This is where the 
**syntesis** functionality comes in. The most often used variant takes
the form of two "colon commands".



- The :syn command syntesizes code from the last result.


- The :NN  (where NN is an integer) syntesizes the indicated element of the last result list. If
last result is not a list, an error is reported.


### Example using :syn

```
$ cd ..
# /home/roar
<obj: Dir>
roar/ d:61 f:33
$ cd project1
# /home/roar/project1
<obj: Dir>
project1/ d:0 f:0
$ :syn
synthesize ok
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .  : Dir("/home/roar/project1")
+-----------------------------------------------------
Assign to name by /xxx as usual
$ /DirProject1
```

When we use "cd" to change to a directory, it returns a Dir object. The shell remembers the last
result value, and the ":syn" attempts to create code representing that value in as direct a way as
possible. If this succeeds, it inserts the generated code line tino the "code history", as the
last command, which means it can now be assigned a name, for example "DirProject"


Calling function "DirProject" will now always generate a Dir object pointing to the same
directory, and is no longer dependening on current directory.

### Example using :NN


To synthesize a single element when the last result was a list, use :NN, as follows

```
$ ls
<list>
0: runtime/              | d:2 | f:12
1: CallScriptFunc.java   | 1k  | 1398  |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09
2: CodeHistory.java      | 10k | 10980 | 2d_22:23:24 | 2020-06-07 12:57:49
3: CommandProcessor.java | 0k  | 365   |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09
$ :2
synthesize ok
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .  : File("/home/roar/Prosjekter/Java/ConfigTool/src/rf/configtool/main/CodeHistory.java")
+-----------------------------------------------------
Assign to name by /xxx as usual
```

If the last value was not a list, the ":NN" command will fail with an error.

## Repeat last program line


The last program line entered (not colon commands or function name assignment) can be
repeated by entering "." (dot), then possibly be followed by additional code.


As the synthesize functions create a new code line, they then insert it into the history as
the last command, which means it can be assigned a name by "/name", but also that it can
be immediately run using the dot command, and extended on the fly, for example like this.

```
$ ls
<list>
0: runtime/              | d:2 | f:12
1: CallScriptFunc.java   | 1k  | 1398  |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09
2: CodeHistory.java      | 10k | 10980 | 2d_22:23:24 | 2020-06-07 12:57:49
3: CommandProcessor.java | 0k  | 365   |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09
$ :2
synthesize ok
+-----------------------------------------------------
| .  : File("/home/roar/Prosjekter/Java/ConfigTool/src/rf/configtool/main/CodeHistory.java")
+-----------------------------------------------------
Assign to name by /xxx as usual
$ ..more
```

Here the first dot is the File("...") code line that was synthesized, then ".more" calls
the more() function on the File object.

## Output format / Cfg


Output to screen is regulated via a Cfg object. It is a session object, that contains default
settings for number of lines and line width of the current window / terminal.


To change these, we use global function Cfg() to obtain the Cfg object, and methods to set or
view the properties.

```
$ Cfg.w
........10........20........30........40......  ...
w=130
<int>
130
$ Cfg.w(100)
```

Calling Cfg.w without parameters produces a long line to help identify the width of the current
windows, plus the crrent value. Calling Cfg.w with a value sets the width. The same goes for Cfg.h
which gets or sets the height of the screen.

### Line wrapping


By default, ouput line wrapping is off, which means that lines longer than the Cfg.w gets truncated
with a '+' to indicate there is more. It can be switched via the Cfg object, but there is also a
colon command ":wrap" which toggles wrapping on or off.

### Number of lines on screen


The number of lines on the screen is used to page content when calling the File.more() and
File.hex() functions. The CFT File.more() function is very limited, and it is usually better to just
open a text editor with the file, or even invoke "more" as external program (Linux).

```
P(1)=file
Dir.run("more",file.path)
/more
```
# Templating


CFT has multiple mechanisms that can be used to produce configuration files, as well
as automated generation of code, from shell scripts to any higher level language,
autogenerated email text, etc.

## Merging text with Dict


To merge values into a template, we use a dictionary object (Dict) combined with the
merge() function of strings. This replaces occurrences of names in the dictionary
with their values (as strings).

```
$ Dict.set("name","Julius")
$ /data
$ "Dear name".merge(data)
<String>
Dear Julius
```

The merge is based on a direct match. Often we like to mark our merge codes. The Dict
object has a function, ".mergeCodes()", which returns a new Dict object, where all names of fields
are rewritten into ${name}. Changing the template correspondingly, this eliminates the risk of
accidentally matching text not meant as merge codes.

```
$ Dict.set("name","Julius").mergeCodes
$ /data
$ "Dear ${name}".merge(data)
<String>
Dear Julius
```
## Using template files


The simplest way to create template text, is to enter it into a text file, which CFT
then reads and processes. The File.read() function returns a list of lines from the
file, which we then iterate over and apply the merge data.

```
File("myTemplate.txt")
/templateFile
P(1,Dict)=data
templateFile.read->line
out(line.merge(data))
/generate
```
## Script file "here" documents


The second easiest way of creating lines of text for processing with merge codes, apart from
editing a separate file, is to use a special feature of the script files, called
"here" documents. The syntax is picked up when reading the savefile, and the lines
of text are converted into code on the fly, becoming a List object.

```
<<< SomeMarker
This is
some text
>>> SomeMarker
/myTemplate
```

Calling the myTemplate function from the interactive shell, produces the following result

```
$ myTemplate
<list>
0: This is
1: some text
```
### A more complex example

```
P(1,"a")=a
P(2,"b")=b
Dict
.set("a",a)
.set("b",b)
.mergeCodes
=data
<<< SomeMarker
Value of a: ${a}
Value of b: ${b}
>>> SomeMarker
->line
out(line.merge(data))
/myMergedTemplate
```
### PDict()


With many parameters to be merged into the template text, the special expression PDict() saves
us some writing. It takes a comma-separated list of value names, which are mapped to
parameter values by position, creating a Dict object.


For missing parameters, the value null is stored in the Dict.


The String.merge() function logic replaces value null for a merge field with empty string.

```
PDict("a","b").mergeCodes =data
<<< SomeMarker
Value of a: ${a}
Value of b: ${b}
>>> SomeMarker
->line
out(line.merge(data))
/myMergedTemplate
```
## Using DataFile


Another mechanism for templating, particularly if the text blocks are big, is the
DataFile function and object, which processes
a single text file which can contain numerous individual templates.


The different templates are separated by a user defined selector string, and given names,
by which they are accessed from code.


Example data file 'data.txt'

```
### A
This is
template A
### B
This is
template B
```

The code to use this file consists of creating the DataFile object, passing the separator
string as a parameter, then accessing the individual templates.

```
$ DataFile(File("data.txt"),"###")
$Â /df
$ df.get("A")
<list>
This is
template A
```
### Include blank lines


The function DataFile.get() returns only non-blank lines. To get all lines, use function getAll().

### Filter away comments


Also, DataFile has support for comments in the template text, which can be automatically
removed. They are defined by another prefix string as follows:

```
$ DataFile(someFile,"###").comment("//")
$ /df
```

Now all lines starting with "//" are automatically stripped from any output.

# Use as a calculator

## Expressions and "variables"


Having a running instance of CFT on the desktop means access to a capable calculator.

```
$ 24*60*60
<int>
86400
/x
x*365
<int>
31536000
```

As noted before, the symbol "x" does not refer to the value 86400, but to the code that
generates the value.

## Lib.Math


The global function Lib() creates a Lib object, which in turn contains functions that
create other objects, such as the Math object, which contains trigonometric functions.

## Lib.Convert


The Lib.Convert function returns another object, which contains code for lots of common
conversions. Use the help system to show all options.

```
$ Lib.Convert help
```
## Lib.Plot


The Lib.Plot function returns an object with functions for creating a primitive plot, for
visualizing data. Again, use the help system to examine options.


Note that Lib.Plot is a quick-and-dirty implementation. For better graphs, some external
package should be invoked.

```
File("/tmp/" + currentTimeMillis+".txt")
/tmpFile
tmpFile =f
Lib.Data.each(0,720)->i
f.append(""+Lib.Math.sin(i) + "," + Lib.Math.cos(i))
|
Lib.Plot.typeTimeline.readCSVFile(f).plot(File("out.png"))
f.delete
/DemoPlot
```

The above code generates an example plot as a png file in the current directory.

# Various advanced topics

## Predicate calls


Example: to decide if a string is an integer, without
resorting to either creating a built-in predicate function like .isInt, or even
using regular expression matching, there is the 
**predicate call** functionality,
where one calls a function in a special way, resulting in a boolean value that tells
if the call was ok or not.


Dotted calls are made into predicate calls, by adding a '?' questionmark between the dot
and the function name.
```
"sdf".?parseInt
<boolean>
false
"123".?parseInt
<boolean>
true
```
## Calling functions in external scripts


Sometimes we want to call a useful function in another script file. This is
implemented with the "call" expression below.

```
call "Script:Function" (....)
```

Parameters are given as a list of values inside ()'s and may be omitted if no parameters.

### Session state


The session state is where previous values to Input() are stored, as well as values
stored with ValDef(). When invoking some function in another script, that code runs in
a separate environment ("ObjGlobal"), so as to avoid cross-contamination.


Further, the separate environments for all external scripts invoked, are cached, so that
each call to a function in the same script, is run within the same environment.


This lets individual scripts have persistent session state, that is remembered between
calls, which means Input() remembers what you typed in last time, etc.

### Session state tree


If code inside an external script in turn calls code inside 
**another** script, then
the same rule applies, creating in effect a tree of session states for scripts invoked
from other scripts.

## Command line args


If CFT is invoked with command line arguments, the first is the name of the script,
that is, a savefile minus the "savefile" prefix and ".txt" ending.


Then follows zero
or more command lines, on string format. Example:

```
./cft Code "S"
```
## List.push()


The push() function of the List object pushes a number of value from the list onto the stack
to be assigned in "logical" order, and allows us to supply a default value if list too short.

```
$ List("x","y").split.push(3,"*")=a=b=c a+":"+b+":"+c
<String>
x:y:*
```
## Dict set strings


Reading name-value assignments from a property file or similar, is best done via the .setStr()
function on the Dict object. It strips whitespace and accepts both colon and '='.

```
Dict.setStr("a : b")
/d
d.get("a")
<String>
b
```

To process a property file, assuming commented lines start with '#', we can do
this:

```
P(1) =propFile
Dict =d
propFile.read->line
reject(line.trim.startsWith("#"))
assert(line.contains(":") || line.contains("="))
d.setStr(line)
|
d
/GetProps
```
## Dict values as properties


For readability, values with names that are valid identifiers, and don't collide with regular
member functions, can be referenced via dotted notation, for increased readability.

```
Dict.set("a","b")
/d
d.a
<String>
b
```
## Dict.get with default value


The Dict.get() method takes an optional default-value which is returned if no value
associated with the name, but in that case the default value is 
**also stored** in the
dictionary.


Usually this makes sense only for session objects.

```
ValDef("data",Dict)
Val("data").get("a",3)
<int>
3
Val("data").keys
<list>
0: a
```
## List.nth() negative indexes


Using negative indexes to List.nth() counts from the end of the list. Using value -1 returns the
last element, -2 the second last, and so on.

```
List(1,2,3,4).nth(-1)
<int>
```
## Working with text lines from stdin


If you've got some text in the copy-paste buffer that you want to work with, the
readLines() global functions can be used. It takes one parameter, which is an end-marker, which must
occur alone on a line, to mark the end.


The readLines() function returns a list of strings, which you can turn into code and save under
some function name, using synthesis.

```
readLines("XXX")
(paste or enter text, then enter end-marker manually)
XXX
&lgt;list>
0: ...
1: ...
:syn
/someName
...
```
## Function parameters as List or Dict


In addition to grabbing one parameter at a time, using P(pos), we can also process the
parameter values as a list and as a dictionary.


The function parameter expression P() when used with no parameters, returns a list of
the parameter values as passed to the function.


The PDict() expression takes a sequence of names to be mapped to parameters by position,
resulting in a Dict object. Missing values lead to the special value null being stored
in the dictionary.

## The general loop statement


In addition to looping over lists, there is a general loop construct. It identifies no
loop variable, and loops forever, until break() is called. It also obeys assert()
and reject() as with list iteration.

```
0=a loop break(a>3) out(a) a+1=a
<list>
0
1
2
3
```

If you forget to increment the variable a, or forget or create an invalid break(), then
the loop may never terminate, and CFT has to be killed with ^C

## Alternative conditional blocks


The iteration operator can be used to iterate over lists, but it will also iterate over
single values, which means the loop body is executed exactly once.


There are two exceptions, and that is if the value is either 
**null**or boolean 
**false**. For these values, the iteration statement does not run
the loop body at all.


Note that the iteration loop still requires a loop variable, even though
we know its value will always be true in this case.

```
P(1,Dict)=someData
!someData.get("ready",false) -> dummy
someData.set("a",1)
someData.set("b",2)
someData.set("ready",true)
|
someData
/populateSomeDataIfNotSet
```
## Storing CFT data structures to file - syn() and eval()


Session persistent data are stored and retrieved with ValDef() and Val(), but are obviously
lost when the session ends.

A more persistent solution is to store a data structure to file. This is done using
the synthesis functionality, which is made available as a global function as well as the
"colon command" used before. This means we can write huge lists and sets of files and
directory objects to file, and restore it later, without going through possibly time
consuming computations.


To restore the structure, we use the global eval() function.
```
P(1)=file
P(2,"data") =data
file.create(syn(data))
/saveData
P(1)=file
eval(file.read.nth)
/restoreData
```

This can be used to save arbitrarily big structures, as long as they are synthesizable.

## String.esc() and .unEsc()


As was mentioned initially, CFT has no escape character, so backslashes are just regular
characters. However, we still require a way of converting "difficult" strings to code,
via synthesis. For this purpose, the two functions String.esc() and String.unEsc() was
created.


One rarely needs to call these manually, but they are worth mentioning, as sometimes synthesis
of a string may result in code such as this:

```
"^q^aa^a^q".unEsc
```
### Escape codes


For an escaped string, the escape character is the ^ symbol.



- "Double quotes" ^q


- 'Single quotes' / Apostrophe ^a


- Newline ^n


- Carriage Return ^r


- Tab ^t


- The ^ symbol ^^



To gives a way of creating strings with newlines inside.

```
"this^nis^na test".unEsc
<String>
this
is
a test
```
## Automating interactive functions


Functions may query the user with Input("prompt").get and readLine("prompt"). If we want
to automate such functions, we use global statement stdin() to buffer up any number of
input lines.

```
stdin("read-this") Input("Enter data").get
<String>
read-this
```

Note that both Input.get() and readLine() detect if there is buffered input, and
if so, does not display the prompt or other info (Input.get()). Particularly for Input.get(),
buffering the empty string "" with stdin() means repeating the last value.

## Self-modifying script


Using the stdin() statement without being followed by Input.get() or readLine(), is just
another way of entering commands.

```
stdin("2+3")
<int>
5
```

This can be exploited to let a script modify itself, by redefining
functions. We can also automate running colon commands.

```
P(1)=symbol
P(2)=val
stdin (syn(val), "/"+symbol+"!")
/def
def("filesSnapshot", Dir.files)
```
## Differing between Windows and Linux


A simple global function, isWindows() is used to differ between the two in code.

```
isWindows
<boolean>
false
```
## Simple line editing


When using CFT mainly in interactive mode, a primitive line editor can be used to modify
the code of an existing function, by optionally cutting off text following a pattern, as well
as optionally adding text.


The syntax is as follows

```
$ !x!       # inserts code from function x as text, then executes it
$ !x! txt   # inserts code from function x, followed by " txt", then executes it
$ !x:p!     # inserts code from function x up to but not including pattern 'p'
$ !x:p! txt
```
### Develop complex code in steps

```
$ Dir.files
$ /x
$ !x!->f out(f)
$ /x!
$ !x:out!assert(f.name.endsWith(".txt")) out(f)
$ /x!
```

Note: this only applies to single-line scripts.

## Macros


In addition to inline block expressions that are executed immediately, there is the option of creating
"independent" block expressions, which are not executed immediately, but instead are considered
expressions that return a value of type Macro.


A macro is like a regular function, except it is also a value, which means it can be stored
in Dict objects, lists and sent as parameters, etc.


A macro is written in the same way as a block expression, just that the body starts with
a single asterisk (*), indicating
that this block of code can run anywhere, as it will always run in an isolated context, not
seeing any state of the caller, which block expressions naturally do.


To call a macro, apply the .call() function on it, with parameters as needed, which are
picked up insicde the code in the same way as in functions.

### Simple example


Simple example, using a macro to save typing.

```
{* P(1)=name Dict.set("name",name)} =m
List(
m.call("x"), m.call("y")
)
```

See savefileLib.txt for examples of macros used to implement generic
menu system, as applied to select editor for Linux.

# Example code

## PowerShell example


The following code is an effective way of using PowerShell from CFT, saving lots of typing.

```
# List services via PowerShell
Input("Host").get =host
Input("Service name (including wildcards)").get =service
List("powershell","invoke-command","-computername",host,"-scriptblock","{get-service "+service+"}")
/PSGetServ
```
## Windows CMD


Running commands using CMD in windows, mostly requires the "/c" flag.

```
Dir("...")
/DirProject
# Add, commit and push with git
DirProject.run("cmd","/c","git","add",".")
Input("Commit message").get =msg
DirProject.run("cmd","/c","git","commit","-m",msg)
DirProject.run("cmd","/c","git","push","origin","master")
/GitPush
```
