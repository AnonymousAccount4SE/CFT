<p><i>Last updated: 2020-06-29 RFO</i></p>

<p><i>v1.0.6</i></p>



<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  ConfigTool (CFT) is a "programmers tool", in the form of a Java application that runs in a 
  terminal window. It has no graphical
  elements, which means it can run everywhere. From the start it has been developed
  as an interactive environment, with strong emphasis on automation. The syntax is brief, 
  in the interest of getting useful work out of even a single line of code.
</p>

<p>
  CFT has been routinely used on Linux and Windows, and easily integrates with external commands
  on both. It should run everywhere that supports Java.
</p>

<p>
  Development has been going on since May 2018, and the project has reached its v1.0, as certain
  robustness and error handling functions were refined. It started out purely as an interactive
  tool, with emphasis on terse syntax, since all code was entered via the command line. After
  a while it evolved into editing the savefiles, or "script files". 
</p>

<p>
  Functionality has been driven partially by needs and partially by what's fun to implement.
</p>






<h1>CFT as a shell</h1>



<h2>Navigating directories</h2>
<p>
  CFT started out as an interactive shell-like app. It runs in a terminal window, and offers a simple '$' prompt, where one enters commands.
</p>

<pre>
  $ cd ..
  $ ls
  $ pwd
  $ cd subdir
  $ cat file
</pre>

<h3>Listing files or directories only</h3>
<pre>
  $ lsf
  $ lsd
</pre>

<p>
  The "ls" function as well as it sibling functions "lsd" and "lsf", can take an int argument, 
  which makes them return the element identified by the value. 
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
  $ ls
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: .git/       | d:6   | f:5
   1: build/      | d:1   | f:0
   2: doc/        | d:1   | f:4
   3: lib/        | d:0   | f:2
   4: src/        | d:2   | f:2
   5: .gitignore  | 0k    | 18      | 84d | 2020-02-28 21:25:26
   6: TODO.txt    | 7k    | 7367    |     | 2019-08-15 22:28:46
</pre>

<h2>Show content of file</h2>
<p>
  Now if we want to list content of file "TODO.txt", we can enter
</p>

<pre>
  $ ls(6).read
</pre>

<p>
  Likewise, if we want to change current directory to the "doc" subdirectory, we can enter
</p>

<pre>
  $ cd(ls(2))
</pre>

<p>
  Alternatively we could also write
</p>
<pre>
  $ File("TODO.txt").read
  $ cd doc
</pre>



<h1>The help system</h1>
<p>
  To get information about what global functions are available, type "help" and press Enter. A list of global
  functions is displayed with a short description for each. To get help for functions available inside an
  object, put an object of that type on the stack followed by help.
</p>

<pre>
  $ help
  $ "" help
  $ Dir help
  $ 3 help
  $ 0.1 help
</pre>

<p>
The first produces a list of global functions, the second of functions inside string objects, and
the third displayes the functions inside Dir objects. The fourth lists functions available on
int, and the last for float values.
</p>







<h1>Base functions and objects: File, Dir and List</h1>


<p>
  CFT is a programming language, with an interactive front-end, 
  and offers a number of built-in functions, which produce objects
  with member functions and so on. The most important 
  objects types are <b>File</b> and <b>Dir</b>, plus <b>List</b>.
  </p>




<h2>File() function</h2>
<pre>
  $ File("x.txt")
   &lt;obj: File&gt;
   x.txt   DOES-NOT-EXIST 
 </pre>

 <p>
  The File() function requires a name, relative or absolute path, and returns a File object. As seen
  above, the file needs not exist (yet). 
</p>
<p>
To create a file with a single text line:
</p>

<pre>
  File("x.txt").create("one line")
</pre>

<p>
  To read an existing text file:
</p>
<pre>
  File("x.txt").read
</pre>

<p>
  To append a line to a file:
</p>
<pre>
  File("x.txt").append("another line")
</pre>

<p>
  To page through text file
</p>
<pre>
  File("x.txt").more
</pre>

<p>
  To page through list of bytes (hex)
</p>
<pre>
  File("x.txt").hex
</pre>





<h2>Dir() function</h2>
<pre>
  $ Dir
  &lt;obj: Dir&gt;
  ConfigTool/ d:5 f:20
</pre>

<p>
  Calling the Dir function with no parameters returns a Dir object for the current directory. The Dir
  object offers multiple member functions, one of which is <b>files</b>, which produces a list of files in 
  the directory. We can also call the Dir function with a path parameter.
</p>
<p>
  To create a subdirectory:
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.sub("someDir").create
</pre>
<p>
  Also note that to get the parent directory of a Dir object, we use:
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.sub("..")
</pre>
<p>
  To get files in a directory:
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.files
</pre>
<p>
  To get directories in a directory:
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.dirs
</pre>
<p>
  To get all files recursively under a directory:
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.allFiles
</pre>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>
  The List object is essential for all data processing in CFT. Calling Dir.files() function 
  produces a list of File objects.
</p>


<pre>
  $ Dir.files
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: someFile.txt    | 0k    | 777     | 90d | 2020-02-22 16:38:53
   1: otherFile.txt   | 1k    | 1250    | 49d | 2020-04-03 10:02:44
     :
</pre>

<p>
  Many functions are available on a List object. One frequently used is "nth", which
  gets a specific element, defaulting to 0 if no argument.
</p>
<pre>
  $ List("a","b","c").nth
  &lt;String&gt;
  a
</pre>

<p>
  For details of available functions, as always use the help system:
</p>
<pre>
  $ List help
</pre>

<p>
  To create file with multiple lines:
</p>
<pre>
  File("x.txt").create(List("line1","line2","line 3"))
</pre>


<h3>List addition</h3>
<o>
  Two lists can be added together with "+".
</o>
<pre>
  List(1,2) + List(3)
  &lt;list&gt;
  1
  2
  3
</pre>









<h1>Core types</h1>
<ul>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>int - (Java long)</li>
  <li>float - (Java double)</li>
  <li>boolean</li>
  <li>List</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All values in CFT are objects, which may contain functions. Strings can be written using double
  or single quotes. 
</p>

<h2>String literals</h2>
<p>
  Strings are written in single or double quotes, and can be summed with '+', which allows
  for all kinds of combinations.
</p>
<pre>
  $Â "'a'"
  &lt;String&gt;
  'a'

  $ '"' + "'a'" + '"'
  &lt;String&gt;
  "'a'"
</pre>
<p>
  Also, there is no escape character, which means backslash is just another character. 
</p>





<h1>List processing</h1>

<p>
  Lists are essential for all processing with CFT.
</p>
<p>
  Lists can be created manually using the global List() function. 
</p>

<pre>
  $ List(1,2,3)
  $ List("a","b","c")
</pre>

<p>
  A much used way for creating lists of strings, is to use the string function split(), which by default
  splits a string on spaces. This means the following produce the same result.
</p>

<pre>
  $ List("a","b","c")
  $ "a b c".split
</pre>




<h2>Iterating over list content</h2>
<p>
  The iterator in CFT takes the form of an arrow followed by a loop variable. For a loop construct
  to return output, we use the out() statement inside.
</p>

<pre>
  $ "1 2 3".split-&gt;x out("a"+x)
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: a1
   1: a2
   2: a3
</pre>

<p>
  The result is a list of strings, as displayed.
  </p>




<h2>Filtering with assert(), reject() and break()</h2>
<p>
  Using the assert() statement, we may abort processing for elements that do not meet a condition. 
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dir.allFiles-&gt;f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
</pre>
<p>
  The reject() statement is the inverse of assert(), and aborts processing for elements that meet
  a certain condition.
</p>
<pre>
  $ List(1,2,3,2,1)-&gt;x reject(x&gt;2) out(x)
  &lt;list&gt;
  1
  2
  2
  1
</pre>
<p>
  The break() statement terminates the loop if the condition is true.
</p>
<pre>
  List(1,2,3,2,1)-&gt;x break(x&gt;2) out(x)
  &lt;List&gt;
  1
  2
</pre>






<h1>Creating custom functions</h1>



<h2>Creating a function</h2>
<p>
  When some code does what we want, we typically create a function from it. This is done by entering
</p>
<pre>
  ... (some code) ...
  /name
</pre>
<p>
  This assigns the name "name" to the last line, and we have now created a custom function.
</p>

<pre>
  $ Dir.allFiles-&gt; f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
  $ /JavaFiles
</pre>



<h2>Calling a function</h2>
<p>
  To call the above function, just enter its name.
</p>
<pre>
  JavaFiles
</pre>

<h2>Listing custom functions</h2>
<p>
  Enter '?' and press Enter.
</p>

<pre>
  $ ?
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | JavaFiles: Dir.allFiles-&gt;f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | .        : Dir.allFiles-&gt;f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
  +-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
  Here we see function 'JavaFiles' and its code. We also see the last entered code line, with
  a dot '.' in front of it. The last code line is the one that can be given a name, and further,
  the last code line can be repeated by entering a single dot and pressing enter.
</p>

<h2>Savefiles</h2>
<p>
  To save all named functions, enter the special command below
</p>

<pre>
  $ :save Test
</pre>

<p>
  This creates a file in the CFT home directory called savefileTest.txt. To load it:
</p>

<pre>
  $ :load Test
</pre>







<h1>CFT as a functional programming language</h1>



<h2>Code only</h2>
<p>
  A major point of CFT is that when we define names using "/name", these names are functions, which
  mean they point to code. When entering code, it is immediately executed, leaving us with a result. When we are happy with the outcome, we may assign a name to the function.</p>
<p>
 The point is that it is the function code that is named, not the result.
</p>

<pre>
  $ "1 2 3".split
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: 1
   1: 2
   2: 3
  $ /data
</pre>

<p>
  Entering the "/data" command
  assigns a name to the last code line, not the data it returned. Every reference to the
  custom function "data" will now run the code over again, and produce (the same) result.
</p>
<p>
  Entering '?' to list your defined functions, you see this clearly.
</p>

<pre>
  $ ?
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | data: "1 2 3".split
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | .   : "1 2 3".split
  +-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>




<h2>Local variables</h2>
<p>
  The inside of a function may use local variables for simplifying expressions etc. Variable
  assignment is "stack based", in that it is the current value from the stack that is assigned
  to the local variable.  
</p>

<pre>
  $ 3 =a 2 =b a+b
  &lt;int&gt;
  5 
</pre>





<h2>Stack vs expressions</h2>

<p>
  It is worth noting that even though CFT uses a data stack, expressions are not stack-based.
  This is because  writing postfix expressions is too bothersome (ex. "3 2 +"), so CFT 
  parses expressions using regular infix notation ("3+2").
</p>



<h2>Nested loops</h2>
<p>
  Loops are implemented using the "for each" functionality of "-&gt; var". Loops may well be nested.
</p>

<pre>
  $ List(1,2,3)-&gt;x List(1,2,3)-&gt;y  out(x*y)
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: 1
   1: 2
   2: 3
   3: 2
   4: 4
   5: 6
   6: 3
   7: 6
   8: 9
</pre>

<p>
  It is worth noting that in this case, the body of each loop is all code following the "-&gt; var"
  construct. But this can be changed using the "pipe" symbol, which "closes" all loops.
</p>



<h2>The PIPE symbol</h2>
<p>
  First a non-pipe example. 
</p>
<p>
  If we wanted to sum the sizes of all files in a directory, we could do it like this:
</p>

<pre>
  $ Dir.files-&gt;f out(f.length)
      :
      : (output)
      :
  $ /sizes

  $ sizes.sum
  &lt;int&gt;
  999
  $ /sizeSum
</pre>

<p>
  This works using the "sum" function on the List object that is the output
  of the function "sizes".
</p>

<h2>"Pipes" and code blocks</h2>
<p>
  The "pipe" symbol '|' can be used to combine these two. What a "pipe" does, is providing
  an end point for all current loops, waiting for them to complete, and produce their output.
  That output is then put on top of the stack, available for the next section of code to work
  with, or to do something else.
</p>

<p>
  To avoid having to define a local variable just to grab one element off the stack, the special
  variable name '_' pops the top value off the data stack.
</p>

<pre>
  $ Dir.files-&gt; out(f.length) | _.sum
  $ /sizeSum
</pre>

<p>
  We call the different parts of code separated by "pipe" symbols <b>code blocks</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Often the output from a set of loops will be used in the next part, but that's
  not always the case, usually when we want our function to return a non-list value. 
  There is a simple rule deciding what is taken as the return value of any block of 
  code separated by the "pipe" symbol (below).
</p>

<pre>
  $ 0 =sum Dir.files-&gt;f sum+f.length =sum | sum
</pre>
<p>
  This code returns an int, not a list, where as the "sizes" function above returned a list.
</p>

<h3>Terminates all loops</h3>
<p>
  Note that if there are nested loops, the "pipe" symbol terminates all these, not 
  just the innermost.
</p>




<h2>Result value from code blocks</h2>
<p>
  The return value of a function is the result value of the last code block, 
  with multiple code blocks being separated by the "pipe" symbol.
</p>
<p>
  For a block of code the result value is decided as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    If the code block contains loop statements, the result is 
    a list of data generated via "out()" or "report()" statements. If no actual iterations
    take place, or filtering mean that "out()" never get called, the result is an empty list.
  </li>
  <li>
     If the code block does not contain loops, the output is the topmost value on the data stack.
   </li>
</ol>





<h2>Function parameters</h2>
<p>
  Custom functions can also take parameters. This is done using the P() statement, which
  identifies the parameter by position, and allows a default value. The default value is important
  for two reasons. First it allows the function code to execute while being developed interactively, 
  and second it may act as documentation, as an example of expected value.
</p>

<p>
  Here we make an improved version of the JavaFiles function, that takes a directory parameter, and if none given, uses the current directory.
</p>
<pre>
  $ P(1,Dir) =dir dir.allFiles-&gt;f assert(f.name.endsWith(".java")) out(f)
     :
     : (code result)
     :
  $ /JavaFiles
</pre>

<p>
  As this function body is entered, and executed, it runs on current directory, since
  the default value for parameter 1 is "Dir". When calling the function without parameters,
  the current directory is always used, but we can now direct it to returns java files from
  a specific directory.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dir("/home/user/project1")
  $ /DirProject1

  $ Dir("/home/user/project2")
  $ /DirProject2

  $ DirProject1
  $ /CurrProject

  $ JavaFiles(CurrProject)-&gt;f out(f.length) | _.sum
  $ /JavaCodeSum
</pre>
<p>
  Now we have a function JavaCodeSum which calculates the sum total of all Java files 
  in a directory defined as CurrProject. To change project, all we have to do
  is redefine CurrProject to refer to another project.
</p>

<pre>
  $ DirProject2
  $ /CurrProject!
</pre>

<p>
  Note: when redefining a currently existing named function, we need to add '!' to indicate that
  we want to override the old definition. Now when we run JavaCodeSum, it works on the 
  java files under project 2.
</p>




<h2>Conditional execution</h2>
<p>
  Conditional execution in CFT takes two basic forms.
</p>
<h3>List filtering</h3>
<p>
  The assert() and reject() statements inside loops decide if the rest of the loop body is to 
  be executed or not.
</p>

<h3>if() expression</h3>
<p>
  The if() statement takes three parameters, the condition, the if-expression, and the 
  else-expression. Depending on the condition only one of the two following expressions
  are resolved. 
</p>
<p>
  In this example we call SomeFunction, then use an if() expression to replace return value 'null' 
  with a Dict object.
</p>

<pre>
  SomeFunction(...) =a
  if(a==null, Dict, a) =a
</pre>

<h3>when() expression</h3>
<p>
  The when() expression is like an if() expression minus the else-part. 
</p>
<pre>
  if (bool, expr)
</pre>
<p>
  If the boolean expression resolves to true, then the 'expr' is resolved, and this becomes the return
  value. Otherwise, the 'expr' is not resolved, and the return value is null.
</p>
<p>
  The when() expression is the best way of expression multiple-choice conditionals ("switch" in Java).
</p>
<pre>
  when (mode==1, SomeFunction(...))
  when (mode==2, SomeOtherFunction(...))
  when (mode==3, ... )
</pre>
<p>
  Both if() and when() expressions have their functionality greatly expanded by (local) macros, which
  are described later.
</p>








<h1>Running external programs</h1>



<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  The functions for running external programs are part of the Dir object, implicitly defining
  working directory for the program.
</p>

<pre>
  $ Dir.run ( list|...)
  $ Dir.runCapture ( list | ...)
  $ Dir.runDetach ( list|...)
  $ Dir.runProcess ( stdinFile, stdoutFile, stdErrFile, list|... )
</pre>

<p>
  The parameters written as "list|..." means either a List object, or a list of
  String values, separated by comma.
</p>




<h2>Dir.run()</h2>
<p>
  This command is used for running external programs in the foreground. What this means is that if
  the program requires user input, we can give it, and the CFT code will not continue until
  the external process has terminated.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dir.run("cmd","/c","git","pull","origin","master")
</pre>
<p>
  Many Windows programs require the "cmd","/c" in front. Notepad is an exception.
  For proper operating systems (Linux) you naturally skip the two first elements of the command list.
</p>
<p>
  Often it is easier to use String.split in this case, as Dir.run() accept a single List value
  instead of multiple string parameters.
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.run("cmd /c git pull origin master".split)
</pre>

<h2>Dir.runCapture()</h2>
<p>
  This works the same as Dir.run(), but returns a List of strings representing stdout from the
  external program, to be processed further.
</p>
<p>
  The output is also displayed line by line on the screen, in case the external program requires
  user input.
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.run("which","leafpad") =lines lines.length>0 && lines.nth.contains("leafpad")
  /HasLeafpad
</pre>

<p>
  Note that though this function shows output from the external program, this is done line by line,
  which will mess up programs using cursor positioning, such as "nano" and "top".
</p>

<h2>Dir.runDetach()</h2>
<p>
  Use to run external program in the background. The CFT code continues running after forking
  off the background process. 
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dir.runDetach("notepad", savefile.path)
</pre>

<p>
  This example runs notepad in the background, with the path of the current savefile as 
  argument.
</p>

<h2>Dir.runProcess()</h2>
<p>
  Similar to Dir.runDetach(), but for cases where we need to inspect the output, as this command
  sets the external program up to read input from an input file, and redirect both stdout and
  stderr to different files (File objects).
</p>






<h1>Editing save files</h1>



<h2>Using editor for entering code</h2>

<p>
  As was illustrated above, in the case of Dir.runDetach(), we can create a function that opens
  the current savefile in an editor. This of course requires a current savefile, which is created
  by colon command save. The savefile internal function returns a File object for the savefile,
  which we use to create full path argument to notepad.
</p>

<pre>
  $ :save Test

  $ Dir.runDetach("notepad", savefile.path)
      : 
      : (Notepad pops up, just close it immediately)
      :
  $ /e

  $ :save
</pre>

<p>
  Now, calling function 'e', by just typing 'e' and pressing Enter, will open the current 
  savefile ("script file") in notepad.
</p>
<p>
  Alernatively, on linux we may start leafpad or gedit instead of notepad, or if running in a
  terminal-only environment, we may choose to run nano, using Dir.run() instead of .runDetach(),
  so as to connect stdin and stdout correctly.
</p>

<pre>
  $ Dir.run("nano", savefile.path)
</pre>



<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>
  Editing the script file lets us write more complex functions. The save file supports
  multi-line functions. The same rules apply as for single lines, regarding scope rules, which
  means loops and loop termination using the "pipe" symbol.
</p>
<p>
  Note: the "pipe" still terminates all nested loops.
</p>


<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
  The hash character '#' indicates that the rest of the line is a comment.
</p>


<h2>The '?' command</h2>
<p>
  The interactive command '?' is used to see the defined functions. For functions entered
  interactively that first line is shown, while for multiline scripts, the first line is
  displayed. 
</p>
<p>
  This may well be a comment.
</p>



<h2>Debug</h2>
<p>
  When creating complex code, we may need to display debug output. This is done with the global
  debug() function.
</p>

<pre>
  $ debug("data")
  %DEBUG% data
</pre>







<h1>Interactive use</h1>



<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
  To stop and ask the user to enter something, we got the Input object. 
</p>
<pre>
  $ Input("Enter search text").get
</pre>
<p>
  The Input object is a bit special, as it maintains a session state, which remembers the previous
  entered values, and offers to use the last value as default when called next time.
</p>



<h2>Searching files / report()</h2>
<p>
  To search files, we usually use the Grep object. It takes a list of alternatives to look for,
  and can optionally be instructed with patterns to reject. It has a file(File) function that
  runs the search on a file, and returns a list of lines that meet the requirements.
</p>

<p>
  But the lines returned from "Grep.file()" are not
  just strings, they are extended strings, of a type called "FileLine". It contains
  two additional additional functions, "file()" to get the
  file object and "lineNumber()" which returns the line number in that file.
</p>

<h3>FileLine</h3>
<p>
  The function "File.read()" also returns a list of FileLine objects, and not just strings. 
  A FileLine object can be created with global function FileLine().
</p>
<pre>
  $ FileLine("",1,File("x.txt")) help
</pre>
<p>
  This lists all the functions of the String type, plus the two mentioned above, "file()" and
  "lineNumber()".
</p>

<h3>report()</h3>
<p>
  We already know that iterative loops can generate output using out(), but there is a second way,
  which is the report() statement. It can take one or more parameters, and results in a list of strings that
  are formatted into columns, for readability.
</p>

<h3>Multi-line example</h3>
<p>
  Below we will show a multi-line example function, which we create editing the savefile,
  that asks the user for a search text, then searches
  some directory for all source files (java), and look for the pattern in each. The result is presented
  in readable format, using report()
</p>

<pre>
  Dir("/home/user/project1")
  /ProjectDir

  Input("Enter search term").get =st
  Grep(st) =grep
  ProjectDir.allFiles-&gt;f
    assert(f.name.endsWith(".java"))
    grep.file(f)-&gt;line
      report(line.file.name, line.lineNumber, line)
  /Search
</pre>

<p>
  After adding the text to the script file using an editor, save it, then run Search in the 
  CFT terminal window.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Search
  Enter search term
  class
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: ProgramLine.java       | 11  | public class ProgramLine extends LexicalElement {
   1: StmtDebug.java         | 9   | public class StmtDebug extends Stmt {
   2: ExprIf.java            | 9   | public class ExprIf extends LexicalElement {
   3: LexicalElement.java    | 5   | public class LexicalElement {
        :
        :
</pre>

<h3>Grep.lines()</h3>
<p>
  To match content from a list instead of from file, the "Grep.lines()" function takes
  a list of strings.
</p>




<h2>Searching multiple types of file</h2>
<p>
  To search multiple types of files, we need to create a helper function that determines if
  a file is qualified or not. Here we use a local variable which gets set if the file name
  ends with one of the file types. We use the "pipe" symbol to terminate the loop, in order
  to return the value of the local variable.
</p>
<pre>
  ".java .txt".split
  /FileTypes

  P(1,File) =f
    false =found
    FileTypes-&gt;ft 
      assert(f.name.endsWith(ft)) true =found 
    |
    found
  /FileQualified

  Input("Enter search term").get =st
  Grep(st) =grep
  ProjectDir.allFiles-&gt;f
    assert(FileQualified(f))
    grep.file(f)-&gt;line
      report(line.file.name, line.lineNumber, line)
  /Search
</pre>




<h2>Searching log files / DateSort</h2>
<p>
  Lines written to log files often will start with date and time. Further, actions that we want to
  trace may span several log files, for example when messages are sent between different services,
  each with its own log. To clearly trace such activity, we search the log files for some text,
  and then sort the lines on the date/time at the start of each line. 
</p>
<p>
  A custom function / object has been created for this purpose, to make it easy to use.
</p>

<pre>
  Input("Enter search term").get =st
  Grep(st)=grep
  ProjectDir.allFiles-&gt;f
    assert(FileQualified(f))
    grep.file(f)-&gt;line 
      out(line)
  |
  =lines
  DateSort.asc(lines)-&gt;line
    report(line.file.name, line.lineNumber, line)
  /SearchLog
</pre>



<h2>Generalized sorting</h2>
<p>
  The List object has a function sort(), which does one of two things: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>if the list contains only numbers (int or float or a mix), sorts them by number value</li>
  <li>... otherwise, sort as strings</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The result is a new list. To sort in reverse order, we just apply the function ".reverse()" 
  on the finished list.
</p>
<p>
  The trick to sorting is to make all types of objects to be sorted into a number or a string.
  This is done by three wrapper functions called "Int()", "Float()" and "Str()". They create objects that
  are subclasses of the regular int, float and
  string types, but also contain a "data" member that can be extracted after sorting, via the ".data()"
  function.
</p>
<p>
  Let's sort the files in the current directory so that the biggest files are listed first.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dir.files-&gt;f out(Int(f.length,f)) | _.sort.reverse-&gt;x out(x.data)
</pre>


<p>
  For better readability, replace out() with report(f.name, f.length) etc
</p>




<h2>Sets of configuration data / Dict</h2>
<p>
  When working with multiple projects, or sources of log files, we want to quickly flip
  between directories, file types and perhaps other settings. This is done using dictionary
  objects, which are "key-value" stores. 
</p>
<p>
  Maintaining such structures is best done when editing the script file with an editor.
</p>
<pre>
  Dict
    .set("dir",Dir("/home/user/project1"))
    .set("types",".java .txt".split)
  /Project1

  Dict
    .set("dir",Dir("/home/user/project2"))
    .set("types",".js .css .html".split)
  /Project2

  Project1
  /CurrProject
</pre>

<p>
  Now building search code that uses the properties found in CurrProject means we can change
  all settings interactively by doing a simple reassign of CurrProject.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Project2
  $ /CurrProject!
</pre>

<p>
  To get a named value from a Dict object, use the get(name) function.
</p>

<pre>
  $ Dict.set("a",23).get("a")
  &lt;int&gt;
  23
</pre>




<h2>Date and time processing</h2>

<h3>Milliseconds</h3>
<p>
  If we want to produce a list of files modified within the last 30 minutes, we can do this
  easily, using the global function currentTimeMillis, and the File.lastModified function.
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.files-&gt;f assert(currentTimeMillis-f.lastModified>30*60*1000) out(f)
  /FilesModifiedLast30Minutes
</pre>

<h3>The Date object</h3>
<p>
  The Date() function can be invoked without parameters, producing a Date object that represents
  current date and time, or it can be called with an int value, which is milliseconds, such as 
  that returned from File.lastModified. Functions exist to decide if a date is before or after 
  another date, as well as for accessing individual properties, such as year, day of month, and so
  on.
</p>

<p>
  To list all files that were changed between two date/times now becomes easy
</p>

<pre>
  P(1,Date)=fromDate
  P(2,Date)=toDate
    Dir.files-&gt;f
      Date(f.lastModified) =fileDate
      assert(fileDate.after(fromDate) && fileDate.before(toDate))
      out(f)
  /FilesBetweenDates
</pre>



<h3>The Date.Duration object</h3>
<p>
  The Date object in turn contains a function Duration() which creates a Date.Duration object. This
  is both output from Date.diff, which calculates the amount of time between two dates, and used 
  as input to the Date.add and Date.sub functions, which are used to calculate other dates. 
</p>

<p>
  Example: calculating the date (and time) 300 days ago
</p>
<pre>
  $ Date.Duration.days(300) =x Date.sub(x)
</pre>





<h2>Session persistent data / ValDef / Val</h2>
<p>
  When working interactively with large sets of data, we have the option of saving those
  data into a session persistent data store. Two global functions let us define
  a named value, and access it.
</p>
<pre>
  $ ValDef("a",12)
  $ Val("a")
  &lt;int&gt;
  12
</pre>

<p>
  Being tied to the session, these data are lost when quitting CFT.
</p>







<h2>Synthesis</h2>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>
  If we use "cd" and "ls" to move
  to a directory, and want to create a function that works on files or subdirectories under
  that location, we have to take care.
</p>

<p>
  The issue is that we can not just say
</p>
<pre>
  Dir.allFiles->f ...
</pre>
<p>
  ... because the Dir() function returns the current directory, which may change. 
</p>


<h3>Creating code from values</h3>
<p>
  This is where the <i>syntesis</i> functionality comes in. The most often used variant takes
  the form of two "colon commands". 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The :syn command syntesizes code from the last result.</li>
  <li>The :NN  (where NN is an integer) syntesizes the indicated element of the last result list. If 
  last result is not a list, an error is reported.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Example using :syn</h3>

<pre>
  $ cd ..
    # /home/roar
    &lt;obj: Dir&gt;
    roar/ d:61 f:33 
  $ cd project1
    # /home/roar/project1
    &lt;obj: Dir&gt;
    project1/ d:0 f:0 
  $ :syn
  synthesize ok
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | .  : Dir("/home/roar/project1")
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  Assign to name by /xxx as usual

  $ /DirProject1
</pre>

<p>
  When we use "cd" to change to a directory, it returns a Dir object. The shell remembers the last
  result value, and the ":syn" attempts to create code representing that value in as direct a way as 
  possible. If this succeeds, it inserts the generated code line tino the "code history", as the 
  last command, which means it can now be assigned a name, for example "DirProject"
</p>

<p>
  Calling function "DirProject" will now always generate a Dir object pointing to the same
  directory, and is no longer dependening on current directory.
</p>

<h3>Example using :NN</h3>

<p>
  To synthesize a single element when the last result was a list, use :NN, as follows
</p>

<pre>
  $ ls
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: runtime/              | d:2 | f:12
   1: CallScriptFunc.java   | 1k  | 1398  |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09
   2: CodeHistory.java      | 10k | 10980 | 2d_22:23:24 | 2020-06-07 12:57:49
   3: CommandProcessor.java | 0k  | 365   |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09

  $ :2
  synthesize ok
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | .  : File("/home/roar/Prosjekter/Java/ConfigTool/src/rf/configtool/main/CodeHistory.java")
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  Assign to name by /xxx as usual  
</pre>

<p>
  If the last value was not a list, the ":NN" command will fail with an error.
</p>



<h2>Repeat last program line</h2>
<p>
  The last program line entered (not colon commands or function name assignment) can be
  repeated by entering "." (dot), then possibly be followed by additional code.
</p>

<p>
  As the synthesize functions create a new code line, they then insert it into the history as
  the last command, which means it can be assigned a name by "/name", but also that it can
  be immediately run using the dot command, and extended on the fly, for example like this.
</p>
<pre>
  $ ls
  &lt;list&gt;
   0: runtime/              | d:2 | f:12
   1: CallScriptFunc.java   | 1k  | 1398  |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09
   2: CodeHistory.java      | 10k | 10980 | 2d_22:23:24 | 2020-06-07 12:57:49
   3: CommandProcessor.java | 0k  | 365   |             | 2020-02-28 22:38:09

  $ :2
  synthesize ok
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  | .  : File("/home/roar/Prosjekter/Java/ConfigTool/src/rf/configtool/main/CodeHistory.java")
  +-----------------------------------------------------
  Assign to name by /xxx as usual  

  $ ..more
</pre>
<p>
  Here the first dot is the File("...") code line that was synthesized, then ".more" calls
  the more() function on the File object.
</p>





<h2>Output format / Cfg</h2>
<p>
  Output to screen is regulated via a Cfg object. It is a session object, that contains default
  settings for number of lines and line width of the current window / terminal.
</p>
<p>
  To change these, we use global function Cfg() to obtain the Cfg object, and methods to set or 
  view the properties.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Cfg.w
  ........10........20........30........40......  ...
  w=130
    &lt;int&gt;
    130 
  $ Cfg.w(100)
  </pre>
  <p>
    Calling Cfg.w without parameters produces a long line to help identify the width of the current
    windows, plus the crrent value. Calling Cfg.w with a value sets the width. The same goes for Cfg.h 
    which gets or sets the height of the screen.
  </p>

  <h3>Line wrapping</h3>
  <p>
    By default, ouput line wrapping is off, which means that lines longer than the Cfg.w gets truncated
    with a '+' to indicate there is more. It can be switched via the Cfg object, but there is also a
    colon command ":wrap" which toggles wrapping on or off.
  </p>

  <h3>Number of lines on screen</h3>
  <p>
    The number of lines on the screen is used to page content when calling the File.more() and 
    File.hex() functions. The CFT File.more() function is very limited, and it is usually better to just
    open a text editor with the file, or even invoke "more" as external program (Linux).
  </p>


<pre>
  P(1)=file
  Dir.run("more",file.path)
  /more
</pre>







<h1>Templating</h1>
<p>
  CFT has multiple mechanisms that can be used to produce configuration files, as well
  as automated generation of code, from shell scripts to any higher level language,
  autogenerated email text, etc.
</p>



<h2>Merging text with Dict</h2>
<p>
  To merge values into a template, we use a dictionary object (Dict) combined with the
  merge() function of strings. This replaces occurrences of names in the dictionary
  with their values (as strings).
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dict.set("name","Julius")
  $ /data
  $ "Dear name".merge(data)
  &lt;String&gt;
  Dear Julius 
</pre>

<p>
  The merge is based on a direct match. Often we like to mark our merge codes. The Dict
  object has a function, ".mergeCodes()", which returns a new Dict object, where all names of fields
  are rewritten into ${name}. Changing the template correspondingly, this eliminates the risk of 
  accidentally matching text not meant as merge codes.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Dict.set("name","Julius").mergeCodes
  $ /data
  $ "Dear ${name}".merge(data)
  &lt;String&gt;
  Dear Julius 
</pre>



<h2>Using template files</h2>
<p>
  The simplest way to create template text, is to enter it into a text file, which CFT
  then reads and processes. The File.read() function returns a list of lines from the
  file, which we then iterate over and apply the merge data.
</p>
<pre>
  File("myTemplate.txt")
  /templateFile

  P(1,Dict)=data
  templateFile.read-&gt;line
    out(line.merge(data))
  /generate
</pre>



<h2>Script file "here" documents</h2>
<p>
  The second easiest way of creating lines of text for processing with merge codes, apart from
  editing a separate file, is to use a special feature of the script files, called
  "here" documents. The syntax is picked up when reading the savefile, and the lines
  of text are converted into code on the fly, becoming a List object.
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;&lt;&lt; SomeMarker
  This is
  some text
  &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeMarker
  /myTemplate
</pre>
 <p>
  Calling the myTemplate function from the interactive shell, produces the following result
</p>
<pre>
  $ myTemplate
  &lt;list&gt;
  0: This is
  1: some text
</pre>

<h3>A more complex example</h3>
<pre>
  P(1,"a")=a
  P(2,"b")=b
  Dict
    .set("a",a)
    .set("b",b)
    .mergeCodes
  =data
  &lt;&lt;&lt; SomeMarker
  Value of a: ${a}
  Value of b: ${b}
  &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeMarker
  -&gt;line 
    out(line.merge(data))
  /myMergedTemplate
</pre>


<h3>PDict()</h3>
<p>
  With many parameters to be merged into the template text, the special expression PDict() saves
  us some writing. It takes a comma-separated list of value names, which are mapped to 
  parameter values by position, creating a Dict object. 
</p>
<p>
  For missing parameters, the value null is stored in the Dict.
</p>
<p>
  The String.merge() function logic replaces value null for a merge field with empty string.
</p>
<pre>
  PDict("a","b").mergeCodes =data
  &lt;&lt;&lt; SomeMarker
  Value of a: ${a}
  Value of b: ${b}
  &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeMarker
  -&gt;line 
    out(line.merge(data))
  /myMergedTemplate
</pre>




<h2>Using DataFile</h2>
<p>
  Another mechanism for templating, particularly if the text blocks are big, is the 
  DataFile function and object, which processes
  a single text file which can contain numerous individual templates. 
</p>
<p>
  The different templates are separated by a user defined selector string, and given names, 
  by which they are accessed from code.
</p>
<p>
  Example data file 'data.txt'
</p>
<pre>
  ### A

  This is
  template A
  
  ### B
  
  This is 
  template B
</pre>
<p>
  The code to use this file consists of creating the DataFile object, passing the separator
  string as a parameter, then accessing the individual templates.
</p>
<pre>
  $ DataFile(File("data.txt"),"###")
  $Â /df

  $ df.get("A")
  &lt;list&gt;
  This is
  template A
</pre>

<h3>Include blank lines</h3>
<p>
  The function DataFile.get() returns only non-blank lines. To get all lines, use function getAll().
</p>

<h3>Filter away comments</h3>
<p>
  Also, DataFile has support for comments in the template text, which can be automatically
  removed. They are defined by another prefix string as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  $ DataFile(someFile,"###").comment("//")
  $ /df
</pre>
<p>
  Now all lines starting with "//" are automatically stripped from any output.
</p>






<h1>Use as a calculator</h1>


<h2>Expressions and "variables"</h2>
<p>
  Having a running instance of CFT on the desktop means access to a capable calculator.
</p>
<pre>
  $ 24*60*60
  &lt;int&gt;
  86400
  /x

  x*365
  &lt;int&gt;
  31536000
</pre>
<p>
  As noted before, the symbol "x" does not refer to the value 86400, but to the code that 
  generates the value.
</p>



<h2>Lib.Math</h2>
<p>
  The global function Lib() creates a Lib object, which in turn contains functions that
  create other objects, such as the Math object, which contains trigonometric functions.
</p>



<h2>Lib.Convert</h2>
<p>
  The Lib.Convert function returns another object, which contains code for lots of common
  conversions. Use the help system to show all options.
</p>
<pre>
  $ Lib.Convert help
</pre>



<h2>Lib.Plot</h2>
<p>
  The Lib.Plot function returns an object with functions for creating a primitive plot, for
  visualizing data. Again, use the help system to examine options.
</p>
<p>
  Note that Lib.Plot is a quick-and-dirty implementation. For better graphs, some external
  package should be invoked.
</p>
<pre>
  File("/tmp/" + currentTimeMillis+".txt")
  /tmpFile

  
  tmpFile =f
  Lib.Data.each(0,720)-&gt;i
    f.append(""+Lib.Math.sin(i) + "," + Lib.Math.cos(i))
  |
  Lib.Plot.typeTimeline.readCSVFile(f).plot(File("out.png"))
  f.delete
  /DemoPlot
</pre>
<p>
  The above code generates an example plot as a png file in the current directory.
</p>







<h1>Macros</h1>

<h2>Blocks of code</h2>
<p>
  A macro is a block of code in curly braces {} that is considered an expression, which
  returns a macro object, which in turn is a value. To call the macro, we call the function
  .call() on the macro object.
</p>
<pre>
  {P(1)=a P(2)=b a+b} =x x.call(3,5)
  &lt;int&gt;
  8
</pre>

<h2>As local helper functions</h2>
<p>
  When creating multi-line functions by editing the savefile, the macro functionality
  can help in creating more structured code. Macros take parameters just like for normal functions.
</p>
<pre>
  { P(1)=name Dict.set("name",name)} =m
  List(
    m.call("x"), m.call("y")
  )
</pre>
<p>
  This creates a list of two Dict objects.
</p>

<h2>Two types of macro</h2>
<p>
  There are two types of macros: independent and local. This concerns scope rules. 
</p>

<h3>Independent macro</h3>
<p>
  This is the "default", and represents a block of code that does not depend on
  the environment in which it runs. This means it needs to be initialized
  with all values that it requires via parameters, but it also means it can
  be passed along as argument to other functions, or even macros, to be called
  anywhere.
</p>


<h3>Local macro</h3>
<p>
  Macros can also be created in "local" mode, which means they have access to
  local variables in the environment where they run. This is handy for some
  uses, though it means the macro should only be called inside the function
  where it is defined.
</p>
<p>
  Local macros are created by letting the body start with a <em>backpointing
  arrow</em>, indicating the macro knows about the environment
  in which it runs.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
  This simple example illustrates the difference between an independent macro, and
  a local macro.
</p>

<pre>
  # Independent macro does not affect 'a' in calling environment
  1 =a {2 =a}.call a
  &lt;int&gt;
  1

  # Local macro does
  1 =a {&lt- 2 =a}.call a
  &lt;int&gt;
  2
</pre>

<h3>New variables</h3>
<p>
  When a local macro assigns a value to a variable, if that variable is not found anywhere, up
  the outer scope chain, then it will be created inside the macro private scope.
</p>
<pre>
  { &lt;- 1 =b }.call b
  % ERROR java.lang.Exception: [input:17] unknown symbol 'b'
</pre>



<h2>Macros are values</h2>
<p>
  Macros are values, but they are not synthesizable, and they have only one
  function, .call(). They currently support loops, but not PIPE functionality.
</p>





<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Automating data construction</h3>
<p>
  The most immediate use of macros is to avoid having to create helper functions. Below
  we use a macro which is stored in local variable 'create', and then called multiple
  times, to produce Dict objects with content.
</p>
<p>
  This macro does not need to access values from the surroundings, and so has no
  back-pointing arrow at the start of the body. This makes the macro "independent", which just
  means it will produce the same result wherever it might be called, if we were to pass it
  along to someone else.
</p>
<pre>
  {
    P(1)=name
    P(2)=path
    P(3)=types
  
    path.split(";")->x out(Dir(x.trim)) | _=path
    types.split =types
  
    Dict.set("name",name).set("path",path).set("types",types)
  } =create
  #
  List(
    create.call("Project1", "xyz", "java"),
    create.call("Project2",  "c:\hub", "java txt")
  ) 
/Projects
</pre>
<p>
  Remember the ".call" to call macros.
</p>

<h3>Macros as parameters</h3>
<p>
  Since macros are regular values, they can be passed as parameters to functions,
  or even to other macros. This means we can create two generic functions below
  to present a list of options, and to select from such a list, without knowing
  anything about the list elements.
</p>
<p>
  Be careful to create independent macros when they are meant to be invoked from
  any other location.
</p>

<pre>
P(1,List)=options
P(2,{"name"})=macroGetElementName
  options-&gt;x
    println(macroGetElementName.call(x))
/ShowOptions

P(1,List)=options
P(2,{"name"})=macroGetElementName
  readLine("Enter part of name? ") =sel
  options-&gt;opt
    assert(macroGetElementName.call(opt).contains(sel))
    out(opt)
/SelectOptions
</pre>

<p>
  This example implements base functionality needed by a simple menu system, and 
  illustrates how we can select elements from a list, without knowing
  how to present them. That is up to the caller, which passes a macro, which we call
  with each element as parameter, to produce an element name for display or selection.
</p>

<p>
  Without macros, we would most likely produce a list of strings to be rendered, then
  at the caller take action depending on the string value selected, which is cumbersome
  and inelegant.
</p>

<h3>Menu example</h3>
<p>
  The following example also uses macros, implementing a menu system, where labels and actions
  are stored inside a list of Dict objects. The actions are macros, which call functions
  Search and FileLocator.
</p>

<pre>
  List(

<h2>Pitfalls</h2>
<p>
  Even though macros may occur literally inside other code, and have their variable scope
  extend into the calling environment ("local mode"), they are still function-like. This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>One can not pass data to or from macros via the stack, since stacks are 
  local inside functions and macros
  </li>
  <li>Loop control does not extend from inside a function or macro to the caller. This means that
    for example calling break(true) has no effect on the caller.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Example:
</p>
<pre>
  loop
    if (someCondition, {&lt;- doSomething break(true)}.call, false)
</pre>

<p>
  This will <b>never terminate</b>. The correct way is to use a variable which is modified by the macro,
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
  loop
    false =terminate
    if (someCondition, {&lt;- doSomething true =terminate}.call, false)
    break(terminate)
</pre>


<h2>when() with macros</h2>
<p>
  The when() expression is a simplified version of if(), in that it contains no else-expression.
</p>
<pre>
  when (bool, expr)
</pre>
<p>
  If the boolean expression resolved to true, the 'expr' is resolved. If this turns out to be
  a macro, it is automatically called (once). If the boolean expression is false, then
  the 'expr' is not resolved, and the when() expression returns null as before.
</p>
<p>
  Example of multiple choice
<pre>
  P(1)=x
  when (x=="a", {...})
  when (x=="b", {...})
</pre>
<p>
  The result is either the return value from the macro, or null if the macro was not called. 
</p>


<h2>if() with macros</h2>
<p>
  The if() expression handles macros in the same way as the when() expression. 
  The if() is about selecting between two expressions, of which one is resolved. If it results
  in a macro object, it is automatically called (once). 
</p>
<pre>
  if(true,{1},{2})
  &lt;int&gt;
  1
</pre>
<p>
  Note that this does not exclude adding ".call" after a macro.
</p>

<p>
  In order for if() to generate one of two macro values as output, just use double
  braces, as macros can be defined inside macros.
</p>








<h1>Various advanced topics</h1>

<h2>Predicate calls</h2>
<p>
  Example: to decide if a string is an integer, without
  resorting to either creating a built-in predicate function like .isInt, or even
  using regular expression matching, there is the <em>predicate call</em> functionality,
  where one calls a function in a special way, resulting in a boolean value that tells
  if the call was ok or not.
</p>
<p>
  Dotted calls are made into predicate calls, by adding a '?' questionmark between the dot 
  and the function name. 
<pre>
  "sdf".?parseInt
  &lt;boolean&gt;
  false

  "123".?parseInt
  &lt;boolean&gt;
  true
</pre>




<h2>Calling functions in external scripts</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes we want to call a useful function in another script file. This is
  implemented with the "call" expression below.
</p>
<ore>
  call "Script:Function" (....)
</ore>
<p>
  Parameters are given as a list of values inside ()'s and may be omitted if no parameters.
</p>

<h3>Session state</h3>
<p>
  The session state is where previous values to Input() are stored, as well as values
  stored with ValDef(). When invoking some function in another script, that code runs in
  a separate environment ("ObjGlobal"), so as to avoid cross-contamination.
</p>
<p>
  Further, the separate environments for all external scripts invoked, are cached, so that
  each call to a function in the same script, is run within the same environment.
</p>
<p>
  This lets individual scripts have persistent session state, that is remembered between
  calls, which means Input() remembers what you typed in last time, etc.
</p>

<h3>Session state tree</h3>
<p>
  If code inside an external script in turn calls code inside <em>another</em> script, then
  the same rule applies, creating in effect a tree of session states for scripts invoked
  from other scripts.
</p>

<h3>Function overrides</h3>

<p>
  One problem with calling functions in another script may be that they in turn
  depend on default values implemented as other functions in that script, values which
  may not be valid for our case.
</p>

<p>
  To make the call mechanism handle this, we may supply a dictionary object of
  values, using the "with (Dict)" notation before the parameter part (if any). The
  dictionary is a way to replace named functions with values. When code in the target
  script calls a function that is overridden via the "with (Dict)" part, the value from
  the dictionary is returned instead. Any parameters are ignored, as there is no actual
  function call.
</p>
<pre>
  $ call "script:function" [ with(Dict) ] ( ... )?
</pre>


<h2>Command line args</h2>
<p>
  If CFT is invoked with command line arguments, the first is the name of the script,
  that is, a savefile minus the "savefile" prefix and ".txt" ending.
</p>
<p>
 Then follows zero
  or more command lines, on string format. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  ./cft Code "S"
</pre>



<h2>List.push()</h2>
<p>
  The push() function of the List object pushes a number of value from the list onto the stack
  to be assigned in "logical" order, and allows us to supply a default value if list too short.
</p>
<pre>
  $ List("x","y").split.push(3,"*")=a=b=c a+":"+b+":"+c
  &lt;String&gt;
  x:y:*
</pre>

<h2>Dict set strings</h2>
<p>
  Reading name-value assignments from a property file or similar, is best done via the .setStr()
  function on the Dict object. It strips whitespace and accepts both colon and '='.
</p>
<pre>
  Dict.setStr("a : b")
  /d
  d.get("a")
  &lt;String&gt;
  b
</pre>
<p>
  To process a property file, assuming commented lines start with '#', we can do 
  this:
</p>
<pre>
  P(1) =propFile
    Dict =d
    propFile.read-&gt;line
      reject(line.trim.startsWith("#"))
      assert(line.contains(":") || line.contains("="))
      d.setStr(line)
    |
    d
  /GetProps
</pre>



<h2>Dict values as properties</h2>
<p>
  For readability, values with names that are valid identifiers, and don't collide with regular 
  member functions, can be referenced via dotted notation, for increased readability.
</p>
<pre>
  Dict.set("a","b")
  /d
  d.a
  &lt;String&gt;
  b
</pre>  



<h2>Dict.get with default value</h2>
<p>
  The Dict.get() method takes an optional default-value which is returned if no value
  associated with the name, but in that case the default value is <em>also stored</em> in the
  dictionary. 
</p>
<p>
  Usually this makes sense only for session objects.
</p>
<pre>
  ValDef("data",Dict)
  Val("data").get("a",3)
  &lt;int&gt;
  3

  Val("data").keys
  &lt;list&gt;
  0: a
</pre>

<h2>List.nth() negative indexes</h2>
<p>
  Using negative indexes to List.nth() counts from the end of the list. Using value -1 returns the
  last element, -2 the second last, and so on.
</p>
<pre>
  List(1,2,3,4).nth(-1)
  &lt;int&gt;
  
</pre>



<h2>Working with text lines from stdin</h2>
<p>
  If you've got some text in the copy-paste buffer that you want to work with, the 
  readLines() global functions can be used. It takes one parameter, which is an end-marker, which must 
  occur alone on a line, to mark the end.
</p>
<p>
  The readLines() function returns a list of strings, which you can turn into code and save under
  some function name, using synthesis.
</p>
<pre>
  readLines("XXX")
  (paste or enter text, then enter end-marker manually)
  XXX
  &lgt;list&gt;
  0: ...
  1: ...

  :syn
  /someName
  
  ...
</pre>



<h2>Function parameters as List or Dict</h2>

<p>
  In addition to grabbing one parameter at a time, using P(pos), we can also process the
  parameter values as a list and as a dictionary.
</p>

<p>
  The function parameter expression P() when used with no parameters, returns a list of
  the parameter values as passed to the function.
</p>

<p>
  The PDict() expression takes a sequence of names to be mapped to parameters by position,
  resulting in a Dict object. Missing values lead to the special value null being stored
  in the dictionary.
</p>

<h2>The general loop statement</h2>
<p>
  In addition to looping over lists, there is a general loop construct. It identifies no
  loop variable, and loops forever, until break() is called. It also obeys assert()
  and reject() as with list iteration. 
</p>
<pre>
  0=a loop break(a>3) out(a) a+1=a
  &lt;list&gt;
  0
  1
  2
  3
</pre>
<p>
  If you forget to increment the variable a, or forget or create an invalid break(), then
  the loop may never terminate, and CFT has to be killed with ^C
</p>



<h2>Complex conditional blocks</h2>
<p>
  The iteration operator can be used to iterate over lists, but it will also iterate over
  single values, which means the loop body is executed exactly once.
</p>
<p>
  There are two exceptions, and that is if the value is either <em>null</em>
  or boolean <em>false</em>. For these values, the iteration statement does not run
  the loop body at all. 
</p>
<p>
  Note that the iteration loop still requires a loop variable, even though
  we know its value will always be true in this case.
</p>
<pre>
  P(1,Dict)=someData
  !someData.get("ready",false) -&gt; dummy
    someData.set("a",1)
    someData.set("b",2)
    someData.set("ready",true)
  |
  someData
  /populateSomeDataIfNotSet
</pre>

<h2>Storing CFT data structures to file - syn() and eval()</h2>
<p>
  Session persistent data are stored and retrieved with ValDef() and Val(), but are obviously
  lost when the session ends.
<p>
  A more persistent solution is to store a data structure to file. This is done using
  the synthesis functionality, which is made available as a global function as well as the
  "colon command" used before. This means we can write huge lists and sets of files and
  directory objects to file, and restore it later, without going through possibly time
  consuming computations.
</p>
<p>
  To restore the structure, we use the global eval() function.

<pre>

  P(1)=file
  P(2,"data") =data
    file.create(syn(data))
  /saveData

  P(1)=file
  eval(file.read.nth)
  /restoreData
</pre>
<p>
  This can be used to save arbitrarily big structures, as long as they are synthesizable.
</p>



<h2>String.esc() and .unEsc()</h2>
<p>
  As was mentioned initially, CFT has no escape character, so backslashes are just regular
  characters. However, we still require a way of converting "difficult" strings to code,
  via synthesis. For this purpose, the two functions String.esc() and String.unEsc() was
  created.
</p>
<p>
  One rarely needs to call these manually, but they are worth mentioning, as sometimes synthesis
  of a string may result in code such as this:
</p>
<pre>
  "^q^aa^a^q".unEsc
</pre>

<h3>Escape codes</h3>
<p>
  For an escaped string, the escape character is the ^ symbol.
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>"Double quotes"</td><td>^q</td></tr>
  <tr><td>'Single quotes' / Apostrophe</td><td>^a</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Newline</td><td>^n</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Carriage Return</td><td>^r</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Tab</td><td>^t</td></tr>
  <tr><td>The ^ symbol</td><td>^^</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  To gives a way of creating strings with newlines inside.
</p>
<pre>
  "this^nis^na test".unEsc

  &lt;String&gt;
  this
  is
  a test 
</pre>



<h2>Automating interactive functions</h2>
<p>
  Functions may query the user with Input("prompt").get and readLine("prompt"). If we want
  to automate such functions, we use global statement stdin() to buffer up any number of 
  input lines. 
</p>
<pre>
  stdin("read-this") Input("Enter data").get
  &lt;String&gt;
  read-this
</pre>
<p>
  Note that both Input.get() and readLine() detect if there is buffered input, and
  if so, does not display the prompt or other info (Input.get()). Particularly for Input.get(),
  buffering the empty string "" with stdin() means repeating the last value.
</p>



<h2>Self-modifying script</h2>
<p>
  Using the stdin() statement without being followed by Input.get() or readLine(), is just 
  another way of entering commands.
</p>
<pre>
  stdin("2+3")
  &lt;int&gt;
  5
</pre>
<p>
  This can be exploited to let a script modify itself, by redefining
  functions. We can also automate running colon commands.
</p>
<pre>
  P(1)=symbol
  P(2)=val
    stdin (syn(val), "/"+symbol+"!")
  /def

  def("filesSnapshot", Dir.files)
</pre>

<h2>Differing between Windows and Linux</h2>
<p>
  A simple global function, isWindows() is used to differ between the two in code.
</p>
<pre>
  isWindows
  &lt;boolean&gt;
  false
</pre>



<h2>Simple line editing</h2>
<p>
  When using CFT mainly in interactive mode, a primitive line editor can be used to modify
  the code of an existing function, by optionally cutting off text following a pattern, as well
  as optionally adding text. 
</p>
<p>
  The syntax is as follows
</p>
<pre>
  $ !x!       # inserts code from function x as text, then executes it
  $ !x! txt   # inserts code from function x, followed by " txt", then executes it
  $ !x:p!     # inserts code from function x up to but not including pattern 'p'
  $ !x:p! txt
</pre>

<h3>Develop complex code in steps</h3>
<pre>
  $ Dir.files
  $ /x
  $ !x!-&gt;f out(f)
  $ /x!
  $ !x:out!assert(f.name.endsWith(".txt")) out(f)
  $ /x!
</pre>

<p>
  Note: this only applies to single-line scripts.
